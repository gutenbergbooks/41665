<h1>THE WINNING TOUCHDOWN</h1>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>A MYSTERY</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Great Cicero&rsquo;s ghost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was Tom Parson&rsquo;s exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A horrified gasp from Sid Henderson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who took it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was what Phil Clinton wanted to know.</p>

<p>Then the three college chums, who had paused
on the threshold of their room, almost spellbound
at the astounding discovery they had made, advanced
into the apartment, as if unable to believe
what was only too evident. Tom came to a halt
near his bed, and gazed warily around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure enough gone,&rdquo; he went on, with a
long breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody pinch me to see if I&rsquo;m dreaming,&rdquo;
begged Sid, and Phil gave him such a vigorous
nip on the fleshy part of his leg that the tall
youth howled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn over; you&rsquo;re on your back,&rdquo; advised
Tom, as he got down on his hands and knees to
peer under the beds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo; demanded Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our old armchair, of course. I thought maybe
some of the fellows had been in here trying to
be funny, and had hidden it. But it isn&rsquo;t here&mdash;it&rsquo;s
gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if it could be under a bed!&rdquo; exploded Sid,
rubbing his leg reflectively. &ldquo;You must be getting
batty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he thought it could be reduced to fractions
or acted on by chemicals, like some of the
stuff in the laboratory test tubes,&rdquo; went on Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; fired back the varsity
pitcher, rather sharply, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s gone, isn&rsquo;t it? Our
old armchair, that stood by us, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And on which <i>we</i> stood when we couldn&rsquo;t find
the stepladder,&rdquo; interrupted Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, quit your kidding!&rdquo; expostulated Tom.
&ldquo;The old chair&rsquo;s gone; isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never said a truer word in all your life,
my boy,&rdquo; declared Sid, more gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sort of queer, too,&rdquo; declared Phil. &ldquo;It was
here when we went out to football practice, and
now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all I&rsquo;ve got to say is that I&rsquo;d like to find
the fellow who took it!&rdquo; broke out Tom, dramatically.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d make a complaint to the proctor about
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you wouldn&rsquo;t do that; would you, Tom?&rdquo;
and Phil Clinton stepped over to a creaking old
sofa, and peered behind it, brushing up against
it, and causing a cloud of dust to blow out about
the room. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t do that, Tom. Why,
it isn&rsquo;t Randall spirit to go to the authorities with
any of our troubles that can be settled otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t an ordinary trouble!&rdquo; cried the
pitcher. &ldquo;Our old chair has been taken, and I&rsquo;m
going to find out who&rsquo;s got it. When I do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He clenched his fists suggestively, and began
to strip off his football togs, preparatory to donning
ordinary clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t back there,&rdquo; announced Phil, as he
leaned upright again, after a prolonged inspection
behind the big sofa. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a lot of
truck there. I think I see my trigonometry.&rdquo;
Getting down on his hands and knees, and reaching
under the antiquated piece of furniture, he
pulled out not one but several books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come out and let the stuff back of the sofa
alone,&rdquo; suggested Tom. &ldquo;We can clean that out
some other time,&rdquo; for the big piece of furniture
formed a convenient &ldquo;catch-all&rdquo; for whatever happened
to be in the way of the lads. If there was
anything they did not have any immediate use
for, and for which room could not be found in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
or on, the &ldquo;Chauffeurs,&rdquo; as Holly Cross used to
call the chiffonniers, back of the sofa it went,
until such time as the chums had an occasional
room-cleaning. Then many long-lost articles were
discovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s no use digging any more,&rdquo; added
Sid. &ldquo;Besides, the chair couldn&rsquo;t be there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the fellows might have jammed it in
back of the sofa, I thought,&rdquo; spoke Phil. &ldquo;But
say, this is serious. We can&rsquo;t get along without
our chair!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; agreed Tom, who was almost
dressed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out scouting for it.
Bascome, Delafield or some of those fresh sports
may have taken it to get even with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They knew we cared a lot for it,&rdquo; declared
Sid. &ldquo;Ever since we had that row about it with
Langridge, the time we moved into these dormitories,
some of the fellows have rigged us about
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Langridge were here we could blame him,
and come pretty near being right,&rdquo; was Phil&rsquo;s
opinion. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s at Boxer Hall yet&mdash;at least, I
suppose he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s on their eleven, too, I hear,&rdquo; added
Tom. &ldquo;But this sure is a mystery, fellows. That
chair never walked away by itself. And it&rsquo;s too
heavy and awkward for one fellow to carry alone.
We&rsquo;ve got to get busy and find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We sure have,&rdquo; agreed Phil. &ldquo;Why, the room
looks bare without it; doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost like a funeral,&rdquo; came mournfully from
Sid, as he sank into the depths of the sofa. And
then a silence fell upon the inseparable chums, a
silence that seemed to fill the room, and which
was broken only by the ticking of a fussy little
alarm clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang it!&rdquo; burst out Tom, as he loosened
his tie and made the knot over. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand
it! I&rsquo;m going to see Wallops, the messenger.
Maybe he saw some one sneaking around
our rooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we once get on the trail&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Phil,
significantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sure is rotten luck,&rdquo; spoke Sid, from the
depths of the sofa. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to do any
boning to-night, and I was counting on sitting in
that easy chair, and reading a swell detective
yarn Holly Cross loaned me. Now&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s
rotten luck&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly is!&rdquo; agreed a voice at the door, as
the portal opened to give admittance to Dan
Woodhouse&mdash;otherwise Kindlings. &ldquo;Rotten luck
isn&rsquo;t the name for it. It&rsquo;s beastly! But how did
you fellows hear the news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did we hear it?&rdquo; demanded Tom.
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we see that it wasn&rsquo;t here as soon as
we got in our room, a few minutes ago? But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
how did you come to know of it? Say, Kindlings,
you didn&rsquo;t have a hand in it, did you?&rdquo; and Tom
strode over toward the newcomer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me have a hand in it? Why, great Cæsar&rsquo;s
grandmother! Don&rsquo;t you suppose I&rsquo;d have
stopped it if I could? I can&rsquo;t for the life of me,
though, understand where you heard it. Ed Kerr
only told me ten minutes ago, and he said I was
the first to know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ed Kerr!&rdquo; gasped Phil. &ldquo;Did he have a hand
in taking our old chair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your chair?&rdquo; gasped Dan. &ldquo;Who in the world
is talking about your fuzzy old chair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you call our
chair names, Kindlings, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us how you heard about it,&rdquo; suggested
Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, are you fellows crazy, or am I?&rdquo; demanded
Dan, looking about in curious bewilderment.
&ldquo;I come here with a piece of news, and
I find you firing conundrums at me about a chair
that I wouldn&rsquo;t sit in if you gave it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of us is likely to sit in it now,&rdquo; spoke
Phil, gloomily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Dan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; burst out Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stolen,&rdquo; added Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vanished into thin air,&rdquo; continued Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if that isn&rsquo;t rotten luck, I don&rsquo;t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
what you&rsquo;d call it,&rdquo; put in the pitcher, after a
pause, long enough to allow the fact to sink into
Dan&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s nothing to what I&rsquo;ve got to tell
you,&rdquo; spoke Dan. &ldquo;Absolutely nothing. Talk
about a fuzzy, musty, old second-hand chair missing!
Why, do you fellows know that Ed Kerr is
going to leave the football team?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave the eleven?&rdquo; gasped Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that a joke?&rdquo; inquired Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only wish it were,&rdquo; declared Dan, gloomily.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only too true. Ed just got a telegram stating
that his father is very ill, and has been ordered
abroad to the German baths. Ed has to go with
him. I was with him when he got the message,
and he told me about it. Then he went to see
Dr. Churchill, to arrange about leaving at once.
That&rsquo;s the rottenest piece of luck Randall ever
stacked up against. It&rsquo;s going to play hob with
the team, just as we were getting in shape to do
Boxer Hall and Fairview Institute. Talk about
a missing chair! Why, it simply isn&rsquo;t in it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more a gloomy silence, at which the fussy
little alarm clock seemed to rejoice exceedingly,
for it had the stage to itself, and ticked on relentlessly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>MORE BAD NEWS</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;And so Ed is going to leave,&rdquo; mused Tom,
after a momentous pause. &ldquo;It sure will make a
hole in the team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s got me all broke up,&rdquo; gloomily declared
Kindlings, who was captain of the recently
organized eleven. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going
to do to fill his place, and Mr. Lighton, while
he says we&rsquo;ll make out somehow, feels pretty bad
over it. But it can&rsquo;t be helped, of course, for Ed
has to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the time being, the news of the loss of one
of Randall&rsquo;s best football players overshadowed
the matter of the missing chair. Tom had
changed his mind about going out to see if he
could get on the trail of who had taken it, and
sat with Kindlings and his two other chums, discussing
what could be done to replace Kerr as
right half-back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bricktop Molloy might work in there,&rdquo; suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Phil, &ldquo;only he&rsquo;s too good a tackle to take
out of the line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you go there yourself, Phil?&rdquo; asked
Tom. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done some playing back of the
line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I need Phil at quarter,&rdquo; objected Dan.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to think of something else. If I
didn&rsquo;t need you at end, Tom, I&rsquo;d try you in Ed&rsquo;s
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m no good bucking the line,&rdquo; objected
the tall lad who pitched for the &rsquo;varsity nine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with one of the Jersey
Twins?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both Jerry and Joe Jackson are too light,&rdquo;
and Dan shook his head. There were many suggestions,
and various expedients offered, and, while
the discussion is under way perhaps a moment can
be spared to make our new readers a little better
acquainted with the main characters of this story.</p>

<p>In the initial volume of this &ldquo;College Sports
Series,&rdquo; entitled, &ldquo;The Rival Pitchers,&rdquo; there was
told the story of how Tom Parsons, a rather raw
country lad, came to Randall College, made the
&rsquo;varsity nine, and twirled the horsehide in some
big games, thereby doing much to help win the
pennant for Randall. He had an uphill fight, for
Fred Langridge, a rich bully, contested with him
for the place in the box, and nearly won out.
There was fierce rivalry between them, not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in baseball, but concerning a certain Miss Madge
Tyler.</p>

<p>In the second volume, called &ldquo;A Quarter-Back&rsquo;s
Pluck,&rdquo; there was related how Phil Clinton went
into the championship game under heavy odds, and
how he won out, though his mind dwelt more
on a fake telegram in his pocket, telling him that
his mother was dying, than on the game, and on
the players whom he at last piloted to victory.</p>

<p>A winter of study followed the games on the
gridiron, and with the advent of spring, longing
eyes were cast toward the baseball diamond
whereon, as soon as it was dry enough, the Randall
lads gathered to prepare for the season.</p>

<p>In the third book of the series, called &ldquo;Batting
to Win,&rdquo; there was told the story of how Randall
triumphed over her rivals, though at first it looked
as if she would lose. A loving cup had been
offered, to be played for by members of the
Tonoka Lake League, of which Randall College
was a member, and how it was won forms the
subject of the story.</p>

<p>Incidentally, there was quite a mystery concerning
Sidney Henderson, or &ldquo;Sid,&rdquo; as he was
universally called. From the opening of the season
his conduct was peculiar, and there were many
unjust suspicions regarding him. It was not until
near the end, when he had been barred from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the games, that the cause of his actions became
known.</p>

<p>Then, at the last moment, when Randall was
losing the final game of the series, which was a
tie between her team and that of Boxer Hall, the
ban was removed, Sid rushed upon the diamond,
and batted to win.</p>

<p>The baseball season had closed, summer had
come, and with it the long vacation. Now that
was passed, and from mountains, lakes and seaside
the students had come trooping back to Randall.
All our old friends were on hand, and
some new ones, whom we shall meet from time
to time. As the weather became cool enough,
the football squad had been put to work under
the watchful eye of Captain Dan Woodhouse,
and the coach, Mr. Lighton.</p>

<p>Before I go on with the story I want to add,
for the benefit of new readers, a little bit of history
about the college.</p>

<p>Randall was located in a town of the middle
west, and not far from the institution ran Sunny
River, a stream that afforded boating opportunities
for the students. It emptied into Tonoka
Lake, which body of water gave the name to the
athletic league, made up of Randall, Boxer Hall,
Fairview Institute,&mdash;the latter a co-educational
place of learning,&mdash;and several other smaller
academies. Haddonfield was the nearest town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to Randall College, and thither the lads went
whenever chance afforded.</p>

<p>Venerable Dr. Albertus Churchill was the head
of the college, and even though he was privately
dubbed &ldquo;Moses&rdquo; by the lads, it was not in any
spirit of disrespect, for they all loved and admired
him. It was quite the contrary with Professor
Emerson Tines, the &ldquo;Latin dreadful,&rdquo; and
when I state that he was called &ldquo;Pitchfork,&rdquo; his
character is indicated in a word. Hardly less
disliked was Mr. Andrew Zane, the proctor, who
seemed to have a sworn enmity against the lads.
But they managed to have fun in spite of him.
There were other members of the faculty, some
liked and some disliked, and occasionally there
were changes in the teaching staff.</p>

<p>As for Randall itself, it was a fairly large institution.
There was the main building, at the
head of a large campus. Off to the left was the
athletic field, and somewhat to the rear was
Booker Memorial chapel, the stained glass windows
of which were worth going miles to see.</p>

<p>To the right of the college proper was Biology
Hall, the endowment gift of an old graduate,
and not far from that was the residence for the
faculty. Directly in the rear of the main building
were the dormitories, the east one for the
freshmen and sophomores, and that on the west
for the juniors and seniors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>As for the lads who attended Randall, you
will meet more or less of them as this story progresses.
Sufficient to say that Tom Parsons, Phil
Clinton and Sid Henderson roomed together, being
called the &ldquo;inseparables.&rdquo; Among their
friends they numbered many, Dan Woodhouse,
Billy or &ldquo;Dutch&rdquo; Housenlager, &ldquo;Bricktop&rdquo; Molloy,
Jerry and Joe Jackson, dubbed the &ldquo;Jersey
Twins,&rdquo; because they came from some town in
the Garden State. Then there was &ldquo;Snail&rdquo;
Looper, so called because of his propensity to
prowl about in the dark; Pete Backus, nicknamed
&ldquo;Grasshopper,&rdquo; because he aspired to be a jumper;
&ldquo;Bean&rdquo; Perkins, who could always be depended
on to make a noise at a game, and many more.</p>

<p>There were some students not so friendly to
our heroes, notably Fred Langridge, who, because
of a serious scrape, had withdrawn from
Randall and was now at Boxer Hall. Garvey
Gerhart, his crony, who appeared in previous
books, had also left, and Ford Fenton, whose
uncle always formed a subject of boasting with
him, because of the latter&rsquo;s former ability as a
coach at Randall, was among the missing. For
Ford played a mean trick on his classmates, and
there was such a row raised over it that his relatives
advised him to quit.</p>

<p>And now, I believe, you have met all, or nearly
all the lads of whom I propose to tell you more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Of course there were the girls, Miss Tyler, and
Ruth Clinton&mdash;Phil&rsquo;s sister,&mdash;and Miss Mabel
Harrison, who attended Fairview. I will introduce
them more particularly in due season.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, how can you fellows stand that?&rdquo; asked
Dan, after a pause, during which they had all
done much thinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand what?&rdquo; asked Tom, starting out of a
day dream, in which thoughts over the loss of the
chair and the loss of Kerr on the football team
were mingled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That clock. It gives me the fidgets,&rdquo; and
Kindlings grabbing a book, made as if to throw
it at the timepiece.</p>

<p>With a quick motion, Phil stopped him, and
the volume fell harmlessly to the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t give you a chance to catch your
breath,&rdquo; went on the football captain. &ldquo;Always
seems to want you to hurry-up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish it would make Sid hurry-up some mornings,
when the chapel bell rings,&rdquo; remarked Tom.
&ldquo;The frowsy old misogynist&mdash;the troglodyte&mdash;lies
abed until the last minute. It would take
more than that clock to get <i>him</i> up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slanderer!&rdquo; crooned Sid, unconcernedly, from
the depths of the sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but seriously,&rdquo; went on Dan. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
see how you stand it. It gives me the fidgets. It
seems to say &lsquo;hurry-up&mdash;hurry-up&mdash;hurry-up&mdash;no-time&mdash;no-time&mdash;no-time&rsquo;!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Jove! I&rsquo;d get one of
those old Grandfather clocks, if I were you. The
kind that reminds one of an open fire, in a gloomy
old library, with a nice book, and ticking away like
this: &lsquo;tick&mdash;&mdash;tock&mdash;tick&mdash;&mdash;tock.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the
kind of a clock to have. But that monstrosity&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He simulated a shudder, and turned up his coat
collar as if a wind was blowing down his back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re just nervous worrying about what&rsquo;s
going to happen to the football team,&rdquo; spoke Phil.
&ldquo;Cheer up, old man, the worst is yet to come.
Suppose you&rsquo;d been robbed of the finest armchair
that ever you sat in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finest fiddlesticks!&rdquo; burst out Dan. &ldquo;That
chair had spinal meningitis, I guess, or the dink-bots.
Every time you sat in it you could tell how
many springs there were in the seat and back
without counting. Ugh!&rdquo; and Dan rubbed his
spine reflectively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; went on Tom, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d give
a five-spot to know who took it. Come on, fellows,
let&rsquo;s go scouting around and see if we can
get on the trail of it. I&rsquo;m glad they didn&rsquo;t take
the clock or the sofa,&rdquo; and he gazed at the two
remaining articles which formed the most cherished
possessions of the inseparables. They had
acquired the clock, chair and sofa some time before,
purchasing them from a former student on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the occasion of their becoming roommates, and
though they had since secured many new objects
of virtu, their affections clung to these three originals.</p>

<p>Their room was a typical college lads&rsquo; apartment,
hung with sporting prints, boxing gloves,
foils, masks, baseball bats, fishing rods, and in
certain places, like honored shrines, were the pictures
of pretty girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, are you fellows coming?&rdquo; asked Tom,
as he started for the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; inquired Phil, who still had on his
football suit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To hunt for the chair. It <i>must</i> be somewhere
around the college. I think it was taken for a
joke, and if it was by any freshmen I&rsquo;ll make &rsquo;em
wish they&rsquo;d never come to Randall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you!&rdquo; cried Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s stay and talk about what we&rsquo;re going
to do for the eleven!&rdquo; begged Dan. &ldquo;But, for
the love of cats, first stop that blamed clock, if
you don&rsquo;t want me to go crazy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His objection was so evidently genuine, that
Phil halted the ticking by the simple process of
jabbing a toothpick in the slot of the timepiece
regulator.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; observed Kindlings. &ldquo;Now,
about Ed Kerr, I think the best we can do is
to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>He got no further, for the door of the room
was fairly burst open, and in came the Jersey
Twins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard the news?&rdquo; demanded Joe
Jackson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The news?&rdquo; echoed Jerry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! We knew it first,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;You
mean about our chair being stolen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang your chair!&rdquo; cried Dan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing about chairs,&rdquo; said Jerry, with a
curious look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; came the echo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse,&rdquo; went on Jerry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much worse;&rdquo; the echo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean about Ed Kerr having to leave,&rdquo;
spoke Dan. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you hear it so soon? It
will be all over college to-night, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ed Kerr going to leave?&rdquo; gasped Jerry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ed Kerr?&rdquo; also gasped the echoing brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Is that what you came to tell us?&rdquo; demanded
Sid, as he got up from the sofa, not without
some rather strenuous gymnastics, for once
you sank into the soft depths, it was difficult to
arise unaided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t know anything about Ed leaving,&rdquo;
went on Jerry, as he looked from one to the
other, &ldquo;but Bricktop Molloy just told us that he
was going to quit next week, and go to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bricktop going to leave!&rdquo; gasped Dan. &ldquo;More<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
bad news! Will it never stop raining!&rdquo; and he
clung heavily with his arms around Tom&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, is this straight?&rdquo; demanded Phil, excitedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! Bricktop told us himself,&rdquo; answered
Joe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s he going?&rdquo; inquired Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To New York. Going to take a special post-graduate
course at Columbia, he said. He&rsquo;s got
a chance to get in with some big mining firm, and
he&rsquo;s got to work up on a few special studies. Oh,
Bricktop is going to leave all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s to become of the Randall football
eleven?&rdquo; demanded Dan, in a tragic voice.
&ldquo;Two of her best players going to leave, and
hardly time enough to break other fellows into
their places before the big games! Oh, fellows,
this is sure beastly luck!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>ON THE TRAIL</small></h2>


<p>Oppressive silence once more filled the room&mdash;a
silence unbroken by the ticking of the clock this
time, for it was mute, because of the toothpick.
But its accusing face seemed to look at the three
chums, as though begging to be allowed to speak,
even if it did but mark the passage of time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can prevail on Bricktop to stay until
after the big game with Boxer Hall,&rdquo; suggested
Tom, hopefully.</p>

<p>Jerry Jackson shook his head mournfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I knew it would be
a bad loss, so I asked Bricktop to stay, but he
said his whole future depended on this chance, and
he wouldn&rsquo;t feel that he was doing right if he let
it slip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talk about futures,&rdquo; murmured Dan, &ldquo;what
of the future of Randall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does seem sort of tough for Bricktop to
leave just when we&rsquo;ve all got so we play so well together,&rdquo;
commented Sid. &ldquo;And only to go to
another college, too! It isn&rsquo;t like Ed, who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to go with his sick father. I tell you Bricktop
isn&rsquo;t doing right! He&rsquo;s deserting in the face of
the enemy, for both Boxer Hall and Fairview are
after our scalps this fall, because of the walloping
we gave them last season. Bricktop&rsquo;s a deserter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be ugly,&rdquo; begged Tom. &ldquo;Maybe
we don&rsquo;t know all the facts. I&rsquo;m sure Bricktop
wouldn&rsquo;t do anything mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course not,&rdquo; Sid hastened to say, &ldquo;but
you know what I mean. If Bricktop&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s takin&rsquo; me name in vain?&rdquo; demanded a
voice at the door&mdash;a voice with just the hint of
Irish brogue&mdash;and into the room was thrust a
shock of auburn&mdash;not to say reddish&mdash;hair, which
had gained for the owner the appellation of
&ldquo;Bricktop.&rdquo; &ldquo;I say, who&rsquo;s desecratin&rsquo; me reputation,
of which I have but a shred left&mdash;who&rsquo;s
tearin&rsquo; down me character behind me back?&rdquo; and
Molloy, with a quick glance at his friends, entered
and threw himself beside Sid on the sofa,
thereby making the old piece of furniture creak
most alarmingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy! For cats&rsquo; sake!&rdquo; cried Sid, in alarm.
&ldquo;Do you want to deprive us of our only remaining
consolation, now that the chair is gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely not,&rdquo; answered the Irish lad. &ldquo;Captain,
I salute thee,&rdquo; and Bricktop arose and bowed
elaborately to Dan. &ldquo;I gather from what I heard,
as I made my entrance, that you have received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the unwelcome news, my captain,&rdquo; and, though
Bricktop was smiling, there was a sober look in
his blue eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ve heard it,&rdquo; answered Kindlings,
shortly. &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, my captain, and it&rsquo;s infernally sorry I
am to have to confirm it. But I&rsquo;ve got to go, and
that right soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; murmured the captain. &ldquo;Well, the
sooner the quicker, I suppose. Kerr goes this
week, also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! Kerr going?&rdquo; Bricktop was manifestly
surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His father&rsquo;s sick&mdash;Europe&mdash;Ed&rsquo;s going with
him,&rdquo; disjointedly declaimed Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; whistled the Irish lad. &ldquo;Now I <i>sure</i>
am sorry I&rsquo;m leavin&rsquo;. Not that I&rsquo;m any better
than any other player, my captain, but I know
what it means to take two men out of the team
at this late day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not throwing any bouquets at yourself,&rdquo;
spoke Dan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the worst blow Randall
has had in a long time. We were just at the point
where we had begun to gain ground after the long
practice, and now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there no way you can stay on?&rdquo; asked Phil,
softly.</p>

<p>Bricktop shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means a big thing to me,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
know it looks like desertin&rsquo;, as ye call it, but, fellows,
believe me, I&rsquo;m not. It&mdash;it goes to me heart
as much as it does to yours,&rdquo; and Bricktop swallowed
a big lump in his throat. When he was
much affected he always &ldquo;degenerated to the language
of his forebears of the Emerald Isle,&rdquo; as
he used to say. And he was much affected now&mdash;there
was no doubt of that. &ldquo;I wish I could stay&mdash;but
I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he concluded, brokenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Randall will have to do the best she
can,&rdquo; spoke Dan, after a pause, and with a heavy
sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<a href="#image02">Isn&rsquo;t there plenty of good material in the
scrub</a>, and some in the Freshman eleven?&rdquo; <a href="#image02">asked
Sid.</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">
<a id="image02" name="image02"><img src="images/image02.jpg" width="381" height="600" alt="&ldquo;ISN&rsquo;T THERE PLENTY OF GOOD MATERIAL IN

<span class="caption"><a href="#Page_22">&ldquo;ISN&rsquo;T THERE PLENTY OF GOOD MATERIAL IN
THE SCRUB?&rdquo; ASKED SID.</a></span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t so much a question of material,
as it is breaking them in,&rdquo; answered the captain.
&ldquo;The great fault with some of our playing in the
past was that we didn&rsquo;t have team work. This
season we have it, and after a lot of grind we
fellows were playing together like one. Look
how we walked away with Dodville Prep in the
first game of the season. That showed what
we could do. Now the team&rsquo;s going to be disrupted&mdash;two
of the best men&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, captain,&rdquo; interrupted Bricktop, with
a short laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean it,&rdquo; went on Kindlings, energetically.
&ldquo;Two of our best men leave, and it&rsquo;s almost too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
late to get others to run with the team like the
perfect machine it ought to be. But, we&rsquo;ve got
to do our best. Come on, Bricktop, we&rsquo;ll go see
Mr. Lighton, and hear what he has to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are a couple of new fellows coming
soon,&rdquo; remarked Joe Jackson, as he and his
brother arose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One is Frank Simpson. I heard Bascome
speaking of him the other day. He&rsquo;s played on
some western eleven, I believe, and has quite a
name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, those western fellows are big and
strong,&rdquo; put in Jerry Jackson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t tell anything about it,&rdquo; said
Dan, despairingly. &ldquo;A new fellow can&rsquo;t be broken
in at this late day. I&rsquo;ll have to depend on some
of the scrub. Who else is coming to Randall?
Do either of you twins know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard Proc. Zane talking to Moses about
some new students who were going to enter,&rdquo; replied
Jerry, &ldquo;but Simpson is the only one whose
name I heard mentioned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; urged Dan. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go see
the coach. Maybe he has someone in mind, and
you can stay on a few days and help break him
in, Bricktop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll stay as long as I can,&rdquo; agreed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Irish lad. &ldquo;It ought to be easy to get someone
to work in at left guard, where I play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get anyone to beat you,&rdquo; spoke Dan,
sincerely. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you see our old armchair walking around
the campus, send it home,&rdquo; requested Phil, earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; chorused his chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seriously though, fellows,&rdquo; said Tom, when
the delegation had left the room, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to
do something. Let&rsquo;s go out and make some inquiries.
It was a nervy thing for anyone to do,
to come in here and carry off our chair. I don&rsquo;t
believe it was any freshmen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; agreed Phil. &ldquo;Wait until I
dress and I&rsquo;ll be with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; added Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t wait!&rdquo; cried Tom, impatiently.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go out and see what I can learn. You fellows
come when you get ready. We&rsquo;ve got plenty
of time before grub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom&rsquo;s first act was to seek out Wallops, one
of the assistant janitors, or messengers, about the
college. From that youth he inquired whether he
had seen anyone taking the chair away, or
whether he had heard of it being removed in a
joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, you mean that old big chair that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
so&mdash;so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and Wallops hesitated, evidently in
embarrassment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the one&mdash;the old rattletrap!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tom. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to say it, Wallops.
The chair was pretty well bunged up, but
we think a lot of it, and we wouldn&rsquo;t have it lost
for a good deal. Can you give us a clew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Parsons, I didn&rsquo;t see any one take
it, but there was a second-hand dealer around the
college to-day. He comes every once in a while,
to buy up the things the students don&rsquo;t want any
more. He was here, and he took away a wagon-load
of stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say
so before? Was our chair on the wagon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see that one, though he had some
small chairs, and a bureau.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was he? Where&rsquo;s his place? I&rsquo;ll go
see him at once!&rdquo; cried the pitcher. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager
he sneaked in our room, and took it while we were
out. Who was he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isaac Komsky,&rdquo; replied Wallops. &ldquo;He has a
second-hand store on Water street, in Haddonfield.
But I don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the fellow all right!&rdquo; cried Tom, excitedly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make him give that chair up, if we
have to tear his shop apart!&rdquo; and he raced back
to the room to tell his chums.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>ANOTHER DISAPPEARANCE</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Hello! What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; demanded Sid, as he
and Phil, about to leave their apartment, were
almost hurled from their feet when Tom burst in.
&ldquo;What in the name of the Gaelic Wars ails you,
Tom? Has some one else left the team; or is
the college on fire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, why this unseemly haste?&rdquo; came from
Phil, as he sank back on the sofa and endeavored
to recover his breath, which was almost at the
vanishing point because of the suddenness of his
chum&rsquo;s advent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haste? I guess you&rsquo;d be in a hurry if you
just heard what I did!&rdquo; exploded Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on
the track of our chair! What&rsquo;s the matter with
you fellows, anyhow? I thought you were coming
out and help me get on the trail of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sid had to look at Miss Harrison&rsquo;s picture
before he could venture out,&rdquo; replied Phil,
with a mocking grin at his chum. And then he
dodged to escape a book, while Tom murmured:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You old misogynist! And me working like
a detective to get on the trail of our beloved
chair! What kept you in, Phil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t get his tie fixed to suit him,&rdquo; responded
Sid, thus getting one in on the quarter-back,
who was rather noted for his taste in neck
scarfs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, come on, now!&rdquo; urged the pitcher.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got time enough to get to town and back
before the &lsquo;eats,&rsquo; and if we go now Proc. Zane
won&rsquo;t be so apt to spot us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the game?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Second-hand Shylock has our chair,&rdquo; explained
Tom briefly, as he told of the information Wallops
had given him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go talk to him like
a Dutch uncle, and make him tell how he dared
come into our rooms while we were at practice.
Come on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The nerve of Komsky!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with
you,&rdquo; and the three lads hurried from the college,
crossed the campus, and were headed for a trolley
that would take them to the village. They saw
the car coming, and were about to sprint for it,
when Tom became aware of the figure of a small,
fussy little man striding toward them from behind
a row of trees, holding up his hand as if to command
a halt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zane!&rdquo; gasped the pitcher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The proctor,&rdquo; added Phil, in a whisper. &ldquo;He
hasn&rsquo;t any right to stop us now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But whether the official had the right or not,
he was evidently going to exercise it, and our
heroes thought it better to obey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, young gentlemen,&rdquo; began the proctor,
as he strode up to the trio, &ldquo;you are evidently
going to the village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Tom, meekly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There goes the car,&rdquo; remarked Sid in a low
voice. &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be another for half an hour,
and we&rsquo;ll sure be late for grub. Hang Zane, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask how long you intend to remain?&rdquo;
went on the obnoxious college official.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not very long,&rdquo; answered Phil. &ldquo;We are
going on an errand. We didn&rsquo;t know it was
against the rules not to leave the college grounds
in daylight, Mr. Zane.&rdquo; It was a sarcastic reference
to the many somewhat childish rules the proc.
was in the habit of framing up from time to
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no rule prohibiting students from
leaving the grounds in daylight, Mr. Clinton,&rdquo;
said the proctor, severely, &ldquo;but the reason I
stopped you is that I wish to point out that if you
go to town now you will hardly be back in time
for supper, and that means that you will probably
get a meal in Haddonfield. Also, there is no set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
rule against that, but Dr. Churchill does not like
it. Staying to supper in the village might mean
that you would stay later, and I need hardly point
out that there <i>is</i> a rule about being out after hours.
That is all,&rdquo; and the little proctor walked stiffly
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, wouldn&rsquo;t that get your goat!&rdquo; murmured
Tom, when the official was beyond hearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say so; and also frizzle your back
teeth,&rdquo; added Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we go?&rdquo; asked Phil, doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; asserted Tom. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll fool
Zane, too. It won&rsquo;t take us long to have it out
with Komsky. Then we can go to one of those
quick-lunch places, have a bite, and get back to
college in plenty of time before locking up. We
can arrange to have an expressman bring back
the chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil. &ldquo;I was afraid you&rsquo;d
propose that we lug it back on the car, and while
I&rsquo;d do a good deal to get it again, I think we&rsquo;d
look foolish toting it home in our arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afraid of meeting some girls, I suppose,&rdquo;
sneered Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, supposing Komsky hasn&rsquo;t got it,&rdquo; suggested
Sid, while Phil blushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perish the thought!&rdquo; cried the pitcher.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to get our chair back, and if that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Shylock hasn&rsquo;t it some of the other second-hand
dealers in town have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They strolled along, talking of the chair, the
chances for a good football team, and many other
college matters until the next car came, when they
hopped aboard, and were soon in Haddonfield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell, young gentlemans, vot is it? Somedings
nice vor de college room, ain&rsquo;t it? Yes! No?
Vell, Isaac Komsky has it vot effer you like, und
cheap! So help me gracious, I lose money on
everyt&rsquo;ing I sell! Now, vot it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus spoke the old second-hand dealer, when
our three friends entered. Eagerly he had come
forward, rubbing his hands and wagging his long,
matted beard, while from under bushy eyebrows
he peered at them with eager orbs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for a chair, Komsky,&rdquo; said
Tom, brusquely. &ldquo;A nice, easy, soft, comfortable
chair that we can sit in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, so! An easy chair is it? Vell, I haf
many, und cheap! It is a shame about de cheapness.
Look, here is one, vot is so&mdash;vot you call&mdash;easy,
dot it vould make you schleepy efen ven you
looket at it, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thrust forward a most uncomfortable
wooden rocker, with gaudy cushions on the seat
and back. The cushions were in Randall colors&mdash;yellow
and maroon&mdash;and the chair had evidently
been sold by some student, either because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
needed the money or because he could afford better
furniture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not the kind we want,&rdquo; said Tom,
whose eyes were roving about the cluttered-up
shop. He and his chums had decided on the course
of pretending to want to buy a chair, with the
idea that if Komsky had taken theirs, by hook or
crook, he would be more apt to show it if he saw
prospective customers, than if he knew they had
come demanding their rights. &ldquo;We want an
easier chair,&rdquo; went on Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, an easier vun? Den I haf it. See!&rdquo; and
he brought to light a big Turkish rocker, that was
in the last stages of decay.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sid and Phil had been strolling
about, leaving Tom to engage Komsky in conversation.
The two looked in many corners, and
peered under heaps of furniture, but they did not
see their chair. Nor, if the dealer had it, did he
show any desire to produce it. Tom looked at
rocker after rocker that was brought out, and at
last, convinced that his method was likely to prove
a failure, he boldly stated the case, and demanded
to know, whether by mistake or otherwise, the
dealer had taken their old relic.</p>

<p>The surprise of Mr. Komsky was pitiful to
observe. He all but tore out his beard, and called
upon his ancestors as far back as the sixteenth
generation to witness that he had not even seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the chair. He was an honest man, he was a poor
man, he was a man born to poverty and under
an unlucky star, but never, never, <i>never</i>! not if
you were to give him a million dollars, would he
take a chair from a student&rsquo;s room, without permission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For vy should I, ven I can buys dem efery
day?&rdquo; he demanded, with a pathetic gesture of
his forward-thrust hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess it isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; spoke Tom, regretfully,
when they had exhausted all the possibilities.
&ldquo;Yet you were at college to-day,
Komsky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vy, sure I vos at der college to-day. Nearly
efery veek I am there, ain&rsquo;t it? Yet I have not
your chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was evident that he was telling the truth. He
did not have the chair then, though he might
have had it, and have sold it to some other
student, perhaps one from Boxer Hall or Fairview,
for those lads also patronized the second-hand
dealers, and Komsky was one of the largest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cæsar&rsquo;s grandmother!&rdquo; cried Tom, in dismay,
as this possibility suggested itself, &ldquo;just suppose
Langridge or some of those chaps had our chair!
Say, maybe Langridge put up the game!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly possible,&rdquo; asserted Phil. &ldquo;Come on,
we&rsquo;ll have a look in some of the other shops, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
we&rsquo;ll get grub and hurry back. I think I saw drops
of blood in Zane&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He sure <i>would</i> like to get our names down
in his little book,&rdquo; said Sid.</p>

<p>But a round of the other second-hand dealers,
where inquiries were made, developed nothing.
There were many easy chairs on sale, but that of
our heroes was not to be seen, and sorrowfully
they returned to the college.</p>

<p>It was long past the regular supper time, but
they had satisfied their hunger in Haddonfield.
And, in spite of their troubles&mdash;their worriment
over the chair, and the mix-up that was sure to
result in the football team&mdash;they had managed to
eat a good meal.</p>

<p>They saw Proctor Zane, as they strolled up
over the campus, and the official glanced sharply
at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just wishing we were coming in late,&rdquo;
declared Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; assented Phil.</p>

<p>They entered their room, stumbling in the darkness
over books and chairs, for they never took
the trouble to put their apartment to rights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, strike a light, some one!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tom, rubbing his shins where they had come in
contact with a chair.</p>

<p>There was a click as Phil turned the electric
switch, and the incandescent glowed. For a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the three chums stood in the middle of the
room, gazing at each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it seem lonesome without the old
chair,&rdquo; spoke Phil at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sort of makes the room look bigger though,&rdquo;
declared Sid, as he threw himself on the sofa.
It was a poor consolation at best.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine what has become of it,&rdquo; said
Tom, as he proceeded to get into some lounging
clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now for some boning, and maybe we&rsquo;ll
forget our troubles,&rdquo; went on Phil, as he scattered
a pile of books, looking for his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to the football meeting to-night?&rdquo;
asked Tom, as he finished a hurried toilet,
for a session of the squad had been called late
that afternoon to consider the loss of Kerr and
Molloy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may come over later,&rdquo; spoke Phil. &ldquo;I think
the best thing we can do is to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused suddenly, and glanced quickly toward
the shelf that served as a mantle. The gaze
of his chums followed. The room seemed suddenly
to become oppressively still. They could
almost hear each other breathing. Then the same
thought came to all three.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The clock!&rdquo; they exclaimed in a tragic chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; gasped Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vanished!&rdquo; added Phil, staring at the vacant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
space as though unable or unwilling to believe the
evidence of his eyesight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another mysterious disappearance,&rdquo; exploded
Sid, and then Tom remarked in significant tones:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll have to chain the sofa if we want
to keep that!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>FOOTBALL TALK</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Fellows, there is just one thing about it,&rdquo;
announced Tom, firmly, when a hurried search
of the room had only made it more certain that
the clock was nowhere in it, &ldquo;either we are the
victims of a practical joke, or there is some mystery
here that we will have to fathom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined to think it&rsquo;s a joke,&rdquo; said Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; agreed Sid, &ldquo;only it&rsquo;s a pretty
poor sort of a joke. First thing we know we
won&rsquo;t have anything left,&rdquo; and he looked down
at the sofa on which he was stretched out, as if
to make sure that it would not take wings unto
itself, and fly out of the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was the room locked?&rdquo; asked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; spoke Tom. &ldquo;Whoever came in must
have used a false key.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re taking lots of risks,&rdquo; was Sid&rsquo;s opinion.
&ldquo;How could they tell but what we&rsquo;d come
back any minute and catch them red-handed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is no joke,&rdquo; insisted Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
got to do something. It&rsquo;s too much to have the
chair and clock disappear the same day. I&rsquo;m
going to post a notice on the bulletin board, stating
that the person who took them is known, and
had better return them at once to avoid further
trouble. That&rsquo;s how the ladies advertise in the
newspaper when they don&rsquo;t know who took their
best umbrella at a society meeting. I&rsquo;ll write out
a notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; urged Phil, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I think this thing is a joke on us,
and the more fuss we make over it the more
they&rsquo;ll laugh at us. Bascome, or some of that
crowd, have had their fingers in this pie, and it&rsquo;s
up to us to find out how they did it, and what
became of our things. Now, let&rsquo;s work around
quietly, get the evidence we need, get back the
things if possible, and have the ha-ha on them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; commented Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you <i>are</i> right,&rdquo; agreed Tom, after
thinking the matter over. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep quiet about
it. Now let&rsquo;s get through with our boning, and
go to the football meeting. They&rsquo;ll expect us,
and, really, it&rsquo;s a serious matter. Randall has
got to wake up considerably if she wants the championship
this year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The meeting was held in the gymnasium, and
was pretty well under way when our three friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
arrived. Ed Kerr was not present, as he had to
get ready for his trip to Europe, but Bricktop
was on hand, and it required all his Irish wit to
stand off the many appeals that were made to
him not to desert in the face of trouble.</p>

<p>There were tears in the eyes of the big left
guard as he announced that his decision was final,
and that he must leave for Columbia in two weeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to stay and play in the first big game
against Newkirk College,&rdquo; Bricktop said brokenly,
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s impossible, me lads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d better get busy and consider how
we&rsquo;re going to make up the team,&rdquo; declared Dan
Woodhouse, and when the captain thus gave up
hope of keeping Bricktop, his fellow players did
likewise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Lighton, the coach, &ldquo;we have
none too much time to get at our team work in
view of the changes. Now, Woodhouse, we&rsquo;ll
hear what you have to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until I make out a list, and do some
thinking,&rdquo; spoke the captain, and while he retired
to a comparatively quiet corner to do this, the
coach gave the lads a little informal talk on the
science of the game.</p>

<p>Mr. Lighton illustrated several points. He
showed how the guards and tackle could best
work together to hold the line with the centre, he
impressed on the ends the necessity for speed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
getting down the field. To the backs he talked of
the need for being ready to get into action on the
jump, to take advantage of the holes made for
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have decided to play a game consisting of
two halves instead of the four quarters,&rdquo; said the
coach. &ldquo;It is more satisfactory, I think. Of
course, there is a certain advantage in three rest
periods instead of one, but I believe that a faster,
snappier game can be played by halves than by
quarters. You don&rsquo;t run the chance of getting
stiff, and you can keep limbered and warmed up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about the forward pass?&rdquo; asked Phil
Clinton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that we will work that so much
as we did last year,&rdquo; said the coach, &ldquo;but of
course we will have to be guided by what our
opponents do in the games. That will be something
for the captain and the quarter-back to work
out together. Of course we&rsquo;ll practice it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Onside kicks,&rdquo; came suddenly from Sid, who
had been somewhat quiet. &ldquo;Are we going to do
anything with them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is another matter that will have to be settled
when you play the games,&rdquo; declared the coach.
&ldquo;It will do no harm to try them. I&rsquo;m for straight
football, as near the old-fashioned sort as we can
get it under the new rules. We have had some
hard practice, and we&rsquo;ll have more, for practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
is what you will need in team work, especially if
we have two new players. Now has the captain
anything to report?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Kindlings, coming from his
corner, with a puzzled look on his face, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t
so easy as you would think, and I just want to say
that I hope no fellows feel badly because I don&rsquo;t
select them in place of Kerr and Molloy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure not,&rdquo; came in a chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Rah! &rsquo;rah! &rsquo;rah! for Randall!&rdquo; yelled Bean
Perkins in his loudest grandstand voice. &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can some of that, and save it for the Newkirk
game,&rdquo; suggested Woodhouse, with a grin.
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve thought it all over, and I&rsquo;ve decided
that I&rsquo;ll put Sam Looper in Bricktop&rsquo;s place at
left guard, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Rah for the Snail!&rdquo; shouted the irrepressible
Bean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can be quick enough when I want to,&rdquo;
declared Sam, his face shining with delight at
the honor that had come to him unsought. He
had practiced hard on the scrub, and while he
was not a bright and shining light, he had grit
and stamina, and was very strong. There were
some doubtful looks over his selection, but everyone
was willing to admit that while he was not as
good as Bricktop, he might do after some gruelling
practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And to fill Kerr&rsquo;s place I&rsquo;ll name Pete Backus,&rdquo;
went on the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Rah for Grasshopper!&rdquo; cried Bean. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
jump over their heads and make a touchdown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; begged Mr. Lighton, for there was
a pandemonium of yells and laughter at this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I want Pete to jump into plays when he
has the ball,&rdquo; continued Kindlings. &ldquo;Do you approve
of those selections, Mr. Lighton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Woodhouse. I only want to say
that of course it all depends on how these new candidates
make out in practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; assented the captain. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got
to make good, or we&rsquo;ll put some one else in. You
understand that, Pete and Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; they murmured, and each secretly
determined to leave nothing untried that would
win for him the coveted honor of playing on
the &rsquo;varsity eleven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then everybody be on hand for practice on
the gridiron at three o&rsquo;clock sharp to-morrow,&rdquo;
announced Kindlings. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll run through some
hard plays, do some passing and tackling, and play
a fifteen minute half against the scrub. Sharp
work, everybody!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Rah for Kindlings!&rdquo; yelled Bean, and the
shout that followed, if it did not exactly raise the
roof of the gymnasium, at least testified to the
regard in which the captain was held.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>There was more talk from Mr. Lighton, who
had worked out a new system of signals for the
present season, and he gave the lads a short drill
in it before the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Phil, Tom and Sid had been keeping
their ears on the alert, and their eyes open for any
hint, in talk or action, that would give them a
clew to who had taken their chair and clock. But
they were not successful. If any of the football
squad was guilty, the fact was successfully concealed.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>IN PRACTICE</small></h2>


<p>There was a crisping tang in the air. The
wind had in it just the hint of winter, but the
sun shone bravely down and glinted on the green
grass of the football field&mdash;a field marked off in
white lines, so meaningless to one not familiar
with the game, yet so full of meaning to a player.</p>

<p>Soon what a struggle there would be to cross
those same white lines&mdash;especially the last, whereon
were the goal posts, and to gain which every
last ounce of strength, every atom of breath, every
nerve and sinew that could be urged to lend speed
to the runner would be called upon to do the utmost
that the ball might be shoved over for a
touchdown.</p>

<p>Now, however, the gridiron of Randall College
lay peaceful and quiet under the October sun. The
grass seemed to shiver in the breeze, as if in anticipation
of the struggles it would soon have to bear.</p>

<p>The silent grandstands were but waiting the
cheering, yelling, singing, sport-maddened and enthusiastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
throngs that would shortly occupy them,
to cause them to sway as in a gale with the stress
of their applause, to echo to the thunder of thousands
of stamping feet.</p>

<p>But now the gridiron was deserted. It was like
a battle-field whereon had taken place many a conflict,
but which, like the arena of old, had been
swept and garnished with sand, effacing the
marks of strife, that those who came might not
see them. It was all ready for the next battle
of brawn, practice for which would soon take
place.</p>

<p>Out from the gymnasium came rushing a crowd
of lads&mdash;in canvas trousers and jackets, and in
sweaters, the shoulders of which bulged with great
leather patches. Some of the warriors had on
leather helmets, and others swung rubber nose-guards
from their arms by dangling strings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Line up! Line up!&rdquo; came the cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on for some punts!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Phil, send out some drop kicks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pass the ball!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fall on it! Fall on it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lads were racing about, leaping and jumping.
Some were punting, others sending the ball
swiftly around by a quick arm and hand motion.
Still others, in the excess of their exuberance, were
wrestling or tackling.</p>

<p>For it was the first day of practice with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
newly-organized team, and everyone was anxious
to see what the result would be. Kerr had gone
from Randall, after an affecting good-bye to his
classmates, bearing with him their sincere wishes
that his father would speedily recover, and that
Ed would return.</p>

<p>Bricktop, for the first time since the season had
opened, was without his football togs, and he felt
it keenly. But once he had made up his mind, he
decided to forget practice, though he consented to
stay on about a week, and help Mr. Lighton coach
Snail Looper in his work behind the line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you go, Tom!&rdquo; called Sid, and he sent
a puzzling spiral down the field. The plucky left
end was down after it like a flash, extending his
arms to gather it in. So swift was it, however,
that it went right through his grasp, and bounded
on the grass. Tom, like a flash, fell on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried the coach, who seemed to be
watching every preliminary play, though regular
practice had not yet been begun. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way
to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was some warm-up work, while Mr.
Lighton and Dan Woodhouse consulted, and while
the captain of the scrub was getting his men together.
Then came the cry again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Line up! Line up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll play a ten minute half,&rdquo; said the captain,
and he glanced at a list in his hand. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
how the &rsquo;varsity will line up,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Tom
Parsons will play at left end, Bert Bascome at
left tackle, Sam Looper at left guard, Holly Cross
at centre. Billy Housenlager will be right guard.
I&rsquo;ll play at right tackle, as usual. Joe Jackson
will be at right end, and his brother can try it at
full-back, only I wish he&rsquo;d put on more weight.
Phil, you&rsquo;ll go to quarter. Pete Backus will play
right half-back, and Sid Henderson at left half.
Now, I guess that completes the team. Get in line
and see what we can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And remember what I told you about fast,
snappy playing,&rdquo; cautioned the coach. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to have the scrub do its best to make a touchdown
on you, so watch out. Line up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ball was placed in the centre of the field,
and, as the &rsquo;varsity wanted to get into offense as
soon as possible, the scrub was to kick off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready?&rdquo; asked Ned Hendrix, who was captain
of the scrub, as he looked across the field to
see how his own players were bunched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready,&rdquo; answered Kindlings.</p>

<p>Ping! That was the nerve thrilling sound of
the toe of Hendrix&rsquo;s shoe making a dent in the side
of the ball. Straight and true it sailed, and into
the arms of Jerry Jackson it fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, fellows, come on! Make up some interference
for him! Don&rsquo;t let them get through on
us!&rdquo; yelled the captain of the &rsquo;varsity, as the Jersey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
twin tucked the ball under his arm, lowered
his head and started back with the pigskin.</p>

<p>Before him ran his fellows, and speeding toward
them came the eager scrub, thirsting for
tackles. Jerry managed to run back twenty yards
before he was downed, and as the two teams lined
up for the first scrimmage, the coach shook his
head rather dubiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The scrub is a bit quicker than the &rsquo;varsity,
I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to whip
them into shape. Well, now to see how they tear
through the line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil Clinton was kneeling down behind Holly
Cross to receive the ball. He gave a quick glance
behind him, and decided to try out the mettle of
Pete Backus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seventeen&mdash;eighty-four&mdash;ready now&mdash;twenty-two&mdash;four&mdash;sixteen&mdash;eighty-three,&rdquo;
counted Phil,
but before he had called the last number he had
given the signal for the ball to come back.</p>

<p>It was for Pete to take the pigskin in between
tackle and guard, and, as he received the leather,
Pete made a spring through the hole that was
opened for him. He gained two yards, seeing
which the coach murmured:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got the strength, but he needs to be
a bit quicker. Well, we&rsquo;ve got time enough to
get speed out of him, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The piled-up players slowly emerged from the
heap, and Kindlings whispered to his new man:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good work, old fellow. That&rsquo;s the way to
tear through them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil was already calling off the next signal. He
had found that quick, snappy work in beginning
the signal, even though it was not quite yet time
for the play, had the effect of somewhat demoralizing
the other players, and also hastened the actions
of his own men. Once more the ball went
to the Grasshopper, but he failed to gain, and was
thrown for a slight loss, for the scrub players were
eager in breaking through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; objected the captain, gloomily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know he was going to give it to
me so soon again,&rdquo; spoke Pete, pantingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must always be ready,&rdquo; was the comment.</p>

<p>Phil was calling for a kick now, on the last
down, and Joe Jackson dropped back for it. The
ball was sent out of danger, but coach and captain
shook their heads. The &rsquo;varsity had not gained
as much ground as they should have done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better luck next time,&rdquo; said Kindlings hopefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your men need it,&rdquo; responded Mr. Lighton.</p>

<p>It was now the turn of the scrub to see what
they could do, and they quickly formed over the
pigskin, while their quarter-back called off the signals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
At the sturdy line of the &rsquo;varsity, they
plunged, trying to tear a hole between the left
guard and tackle. They had quickly found the
weakness of Pete, and Bert Bascome was not a
tried warrior of the gridiron. The scrub penetrated
for a couple of yards, and then, seeing what
the danger was, the other players massed their
strength there, and stopped the advance of the
man with the ball.</p>

<p>Again the scrub hurled themselves against the
line, trying on the other side this time. They
could not gain, and Joe Jackson dropped back to
receive the kick he expected would come.</p>

<p>But the scrub&rsquo;s quarter gave the signal for a
fake punt, and when the &rsquo;varsity had spread out,
the right half-back was sent forward with the ball.
But they did not gain what they expected, for
Kindlings, ever on the alert for a play like that,
was watching, and, cleverly dodging through the
interference, he downed the man with the ball in
a fierce tackle. The scrub had gained their distance,
however, and still had possession of the
pigskin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold &rsquo;em this time!&rdquo; begged the captain, as
he got rid of some dirt that had been ground into
his mouth under his nose-guard.</p>

<p>And hold the &rsquo;varsity did after that. Not an
inch could the scrub gain, for the wall in front
of them was like stone, and they were relentlessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
hurled back. Twice they tried it, and on the third
down they kicked&mdash;no fake affair now.</p>

<p>The &rsquo;varsity had the ball again. Phil did not
try Pete this time, but gave the leather to Sid, who,
like an old time warrior, lowered his head and
plunged into the line for three yards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on! Come on!&rdquo; yelled Phil, pushing
and pulling on his chum to help him through.
There was a mass of crowding, struggling players
all about Sid. The scrub, with desperate energy,
tried to stem the progress of the human tide. Still
Sid worked on, worming to get every inch, and
he broke through the scrub line, staggered on and
on, and when he was finally downed, with half a
dozen of the players clinging to him like hounds
to a stag, he had gained three yards, through a
hard defense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! Wow!&rdquo; yelled Bean Perkins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I ought to have done, I suppose,&rdquo;
murmured Pete, regretfully, as he saw what a
gain Sid had made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll do it yet,&rdquo; said Tom consolingly.
&ldquo;It takes a little practice. Those fellows are out
for blood to-day. A lot of them are hoping to
get on our team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; declared Pete, and when he
was given a chance with the ball a little later,
he tore through for a two-yard gain in great
fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The &rsquo;varsity was now playing fiercely, and had
the &ldquo;measure&rdquo; of the scrub. Those unfortunate
lads tried in vain to stem the human torrent. The
first team had the ball, and were not going to
give it up. Down the line they rushed, shoving the
second lads to one side&mdash;bowling them over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Touchdown! Touchdown!&rdquo; came the cry
when the five-yard line was reached. &ldquo;Touchdown!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And a touchdown it was, Sid being pushed and
dragged over the line. It took eight minutes of
play to make it, though, and the scrub felt in their
hearts that they had done good work, as indeed
they had.</p>

<p>There was another line-up, after a kick-off,
and the scrub had another chance to show what
they could do, but they failed to gain in two trials,
and kicked. Then the &rsquo;varsity once more had the
ball, and in the little while remaining to play, for
the half had been lengthened to fifteen minutes,
they rushed it up the field. A forward pass was
tried, but did not work well, nor did an onside
kick, and Mr. Lighton wisely decided to defer
these plays until the team worked together better
in straight football.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think?&rdquo; asked Kindlings,
as he walked to the gymnasium with the coach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might be worse,&rdquo; was the non-committal answer.
&ldquo;But they all mean well, and as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Sam and Pete get more confidence, they&rsquo;ll do better.
But&mdash;oh, well, what&rsquo;s the use of crossing a
bridge until you get out of the woods, as Holly
Cross would say. We have a game with Newkirk
in two weeks, and if we can&rsquo;t beat them, even with
the team we have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go out of business,&rdquo; finished Dan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; agreed the coach, with a shrug of his
shoulders.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>A NEW TIMEPIECE</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Anything on for to-night fellows,&rdquo; asked
Tom Parsons, as he limped along with Sid and
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Why?&rdquo; inquired the quarter-back. &ldquo;Are
you going to see a girl? If you are, I heard Ruth
say that she and Madge had a date at some Fairview
affair, or something like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not going to see a girl,&rdquo; retorted
Tom somewhat savagely, and a spasm of pain
shot over his face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave that for you and
Sid this time. I&rsquo;m going to lay off and bone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Phil, anxiously.
&ldquo;Sick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;m tired, and some one stepped on
my ankle in that last mix-up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Hannibal! I hope you don&rsquo;t go lame,&rdquo; put
in Sid. &ldquo;The team is crippled enough as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; asserted Tom. &ldquo;All it
needs is a rest and some liniment.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wrenched my knee a bit,&rdquo; spoke Phil, &ldquo;but it
doesn&rsquo;t bother me now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d like to get hold of the fellow who
rubbed my nose in the dirt,&rdquo; came wrathfully from
Sid. &ldquo;I must have chewed up about an ounce of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good for your digestion,&rdquo; asserted Tom,
with a wry face. &ldquo;But say, fellows, doesn&rsquo;t it
strike you as rather queer that we didn&rsquo;t get a
hint about our missing chair and clock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is sort of so-so,&rdquo; admitted Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have thought,&rdquo; went on Tom, as he
stopped for a moment in the shadow of biology
hall to favor his bruised ankle, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d have
thought that if it was some of the boys putting
up a job on us that they&rsquo;d have given it away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, such as asking what time it was, or if we
rested well in our room, or something like that,&rdquo;
added Sid. &ldquo;But there wasn&rsquo;t even a look to give
us a clew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which means,&rdquo; declared the &rsquo;varsity left end,
as he limped on, &ldquo;that either none of our fellows
have had a hand in it, or that they can keep a
secret better than we fellows could. If this bunch
had done anything like that we&rsquo;d be wanting to rig
the victim. But I can&rsquo;t understand this silence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means something,&rdquo; declared Phil. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
some mystery about this that&rsquo;s deeper than we
have any idea of.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>And there was a curious mystery which was
destined to have quite an effect on Randall College.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s forget all about it for a while,&rdquo;
suggested Sid. &ldquo;Maybe if we do, it will be like
one of those problems in solid geometry, and
the solution will come to us when we least expect
it. Many a time I&rsquo;ve stared at the figures
and letters until they did the Blue Danube waltzes
up and down the pages. Then I&rsquo;ve just chucked
it aside, taken up something else, and, all at once,
it&rsquo;s as plain as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The nose on Tom&rsquo;s face,&rdquo; interrupted Phil,
for Tom was well blessed in that feature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead. Have all the fun you like,&rdquo; the
pitcher invited, for his ankle was beginning to
pain him more severely, and he did not feel equal
to skylarking with his chums. &ldquo;But as to forgetting
about our chair, I can&rsquo;t do it. Queer, isn&rsquo;t it,
how you&rsquo;ll get attached to an ordinary piece of
furniture like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t an <i>ordinary</i> piece, you sacrilegious
vandal!&rdquo; exploded Sid. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t another
chair like that in college. I have it on good authority
that it was a family heirloom before we
bought it of Hatterly, the big senior. It belonged
in the Hess family, which was quite some pumpkins
around here about the time of the wreck of
the <i>Mayflower</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Mayflower</i> wasn&rsquo;t wrecked, you chump!&rdquo;
cried Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what of it? Something happened to it,
anyhow. It was stranded, or ran ashore, or else
people landed from it. I never can keep those
things straight in my head. At any rate, the chair
is quite a relic, and I wish we had it back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; declared Tom, feelingly. &ldquo;I
could just curl up in it in comfort to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor yet listen to the clock tick,&rdquo; added Sid.
&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s talk of something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Football,&rdquo; suggested Phil, quickly. &ldquo;What
do you fellows think about our chances, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; asserted the end. &ldquo;Sam and Pete
aren&rsquo;t doing as well as they used to do on the
scrub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stage fright, maybe,&rdquo; came from Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s likely,&rdquo; admitted the quarter-back. &ldquo;I remember
when I first played on the &rsquo;varsity, I
couldn&rsquo;t seem to see straight, I thought I was
going to miss every tackle I tried for, and I was
mortally afraid of dropping the ball. They&rsquo;ll
get over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; spoke Tom. &ldquo;I wish Bascome
wasn&rsquo;t playing on my end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Phil, quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know he rather stood in with Langridge
and Gerhart when they were here, and,
though he isn&rsquo;t as mean as they were, he isn&rsquo;t
exactly in our crowd. I can&rsquo;t play with him the
same way I can go into a game with the other
fellows. I think I&rsquo;ll ask Kindlings to let me shift
to the other end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it!&rdquo; cried Sid, quickly. &ldquo;Look
here, Tom Parsons, the surest way to have a
team go to pieces is to have personal feelings
crop out among the players. We&rsquo;ve got to play
together, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Play separately,&rsquo; as one of the signers of the
Declaration of Independence said,&rdquo; interrupted
Phil, with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m serious,&rdquo; protested Sid. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re
going to act that way, Tom, we might as well
give up the team now, and also all hopes of ever
winning the championship this year. It&rsquo;s bad
enough to have Bricktop and Ed off, without
having you kicking up a fuss about Bascome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s kicking up a fuss, you old misogynist?&rdquo;
demanded the end, limping along. &ldquo;I only said
I couldn&rsquo;t play with Bascome as well as I could
with Dan, and I&rsquo;d like to shift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you do that it means that some one
else will have to shift, and that will throw the
whole team into confusion. No, you stick it out,
Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>They walked on in silence for a few minutes,
each busy with his own thoughts. The sun slanted
across the campus, and glinted through the stained
glass windows of Booker chapel, coloring the
sward with a wonderful combination of violet
and red. Back of the main college was a bank
of purplish and olive tinted clouds, which Tom
paused to gaze at in admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, fellows!&rdquo; he exclaimed, softly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
just like one of those pictures of Venice, painted
by what&rsquo;s his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, great artist,&rdquo; put in Phil. &ldquo;Second
cousin to &lsquo;who&rsquo;s this.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but look at those colorings,&rdquo; protested
Tom. &ldquo;Did you ever see such cloud masses?
The only thing about them is that they tell of
fall coming on, and winter and leafless trees,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, for cats&rsquo; sake cut it out!&rdquo; groaned Sid.
&ldquo;You must be in love again. Got a new girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; ordered Tom, peremptorily, as he
started toward their dormitory. &ldquo;The next time
I try to elevate the minds of you fellows by
pointing out the beauties of nature you&rsquo;ll know
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, old chap,&rdquo; came in soothing accents
from Phil. &ldquo;Those clouds <i>are</i> worth looking at,
for a fact. Sid has no soul for anything above
the commonplace.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither would you have, if you&rsquo;d been chewing
on mud,&rdquo; declared the other. &ldquo;It strikes
me that we are getting silly, or sentimental, in
our old age. Come on up and get into a bathrobe
and we&rsquo;ll take it easy. I have some imported
ginger ale, and some prime cheese in the
closet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You rat! And you never spoke of it before!&rdquo;
cried Phil, clapping his chum on the back. &ldquo;Come
on, let&rsquo;s see who&rsquo;ll get there first, as the wolf said
to Red Riding Hood,&rdquo; and he started up the
stairs on the run, followed by Sid, while Tom
limped on more slowly.</p>

<p>When the end reached their apartment he
found the door open, and his two chums standing
on the threshold as though afraid to enter. It
was dark inside, for the shades were drawn. Tom
looked at his two companions in some surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Snake in
there? Why don&rsquo;t you go on in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil, softly.</p>

<p>They stood expectantly. Through the stillness
there came to them a rhythmetic tick-tick, which
floated out of their room and into the corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The clock!&rdquo; gasped Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our clock!&rdquo; whispered Phil, as though to
speak aloud would break the magic spell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s come back,&rdquo; went on Sid, taking a step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
forward in a stealthy manner, as if he expected
to surprise a burglar in the act. &ldquo;Fellows, to
all the gods that on Olympus dwell most everlasting
praises be! Our clock&rsquo;s come back!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>ANOTHER IDEA</small></h2>


<p>Making ready as though to greet an old friend
who had long been absent, the three lads advanced
to the middle of the room in the semi-darkness.
Louder ticked the clock, and it was like music
to their ears. Tom snapped on the electric lights,
and the gaze of our three heroes went together
toward the mantle shelf.</p>

<p>Then there came three simultaneous gasps of
astonishment, a starting back in surprise, a catching
of breaths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The clock!&rdquo; spoke Tom, aghast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t ours!&rdquo; added Phil, gaspingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve brought back the wrong one!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sid.</p>

<p>Then, as they looked at the new timepiece, a
smart one in a new and dull-polished mahogany
case&mdash;an expensive clock&mdash;one they never would
have thought of possessing, as they looked at it,
there was a musical tinkle of a bell, and five strokes
rang out as if in welcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A new clock!&rdquo; went on Phil, in accents of horror.
&ldquo;A clock that strikes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come plump, head-waiter of the cock, to
which I most resort. How goes the time? &rsquo;Tis
five o&rsquo;clock? Go fetch a pint of port!&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted
Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what are we up against?&rdquo; cried Tom.
&ldquo;The plot thickens! There is more of the direful
mystery here! Talk about the Arabian Nights&rsquo;
tale of new lamps for old! Some one has taken
our old clock and left in its place this new choice
specimen of the art of the horologiographer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The art of whom?&rdquo; asked Phil, in wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clock-maker,&rdquo; translated Tom. &ldquo;They say
a fair exchange is no robbery, but this was an
unfair exchange. We don&rsquo;t want a striking
clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, give us back our own fussy little alarm,&rdquo;
begged Sid. &ldquo;I say, though, fellows, this is no
slouch of a piece of horologiographic work,
though. It must have cost eight or ten bones,
and it&rsquo;s brand new. Do you guess some one&rsquo;s
conscience smote &rsquo;em, after they&rsquo;d made away
with our ticker, and they wanted to make
amends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; admitted Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me either,&rdquo; came from Tom. &ldquo;But if they
bring back one of those new-fangled Turkish rockers
in place of our old chair, I&rsquo;ll fire it out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
window. We can stand the clock, though I&rsquo;ll be
hanged if I like that striking arrangement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, either,&rdquo; agreed Sid. &ldquo;But maybe we can
get some clew from this clock. Let&rsquo;s have a
look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned the clock around on the shelf, thereby
disturbing its mechanism and stopping the ticking,
but he little minded that. He was looking
for the maker&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, was our door locked when you fellows
got here?&rdquo; asked Tom, who had been a little in
the rear of his companions, due to his injured
ankle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure it was locked,&rdquo; asserted Phil. &ldquo;I opened
it with my key. Whoever sneaked in here and
left the new clock while we were at football practice
must have had a duplicate key. How are
you making out, Sid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The clock, according to a card pasted on back,
was made or sold by Amos Harding, of Chicago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chicago!&rdquo; cried Tom, in some excitement.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where Langridge came from! Is it possible
that he could have come over from Boxer
Hall, and played this joke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible, but not probable,&rdquo; declared Sid.
&ldquo;But we could write to Chicago, and see if Mr.
Harding could give us any clew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; asked Phil. &ldquo;Chicago
is a big place, and it&rsquo;s hardly likely that a dealer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
there would remember to whom he sold a particular
clock, when there are a whole lot like it.
This clock is of fairly common pattern, though
it&rsquo;s rather expensive. I&rsquo;m inclined to think that
we&rsquo;ll never get on to the game that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you got to suggest?&rdquo; asked Tom,
as he prepared to bathe his ankle, while Sid set
the clock going again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to say that we might post a notice
on the bulletin board, stating that we&rsquo;d had enough
of the joke, and would exchange clocks back
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ve just thought of something!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sid. &ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;s a thief in college,
and he&rsquo;s been going around snibbying things from
the fellows&rsquo; rooms. He&rsquo;s been found out, and
made to put the things back. He got our clock
mixed up with another, and the other chap has
got our ticker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bad idea,&rdquo; assented Phil. &ldquo;In that case
a notice on the bulletin board would be all right,
and we&rsquo;ll wait about writing to Chicago. But
Langridge is out of it, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; declared Tom, half savagely,
for his ankle hurt him when he rubbed it vigorously.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find that he&rsquo;s been mixed up in this
somehow. The clock is from Chicago, he comes
from Chicago, and there&rsquo;s some connection there,
you can depend on it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe,&rdquo; admitted Phil. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s get
at the notice, and then it will be grub time. Might
as well say something about our chair while we&rsquo;re
at it; eh, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; came from Tom, &ldquo;let that go. I think
the clock and chair were two different propositions.
We&rsquo;ll work the chair ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After some talk his chums were inclined to
agree with Tom, so Phil wrote out a notice about
the timepiece, while Sid interestedly examined the
clock, making various speculations concerning it,
while Tom doctored his ankle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, I guess that will do for a while,&rdquo; he
announced, with a wry face, as he pulled on his
shoe. &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;m not lame for practice to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s the notice,&rdquo; exclaimed Phil, a little
later. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read it. &lsquo;For exchange: one mahogany-case
clock, new; striking the hours and half
hours&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; interrupted Sid. &ldquo;<i>Does</i> it strike
the half hours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, they all do,&rdquo; asserted Phil, and as if in
confirmation of his words, there tinkled out a
silvery stroke at five-thirty. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d I tell you?&rdquo;
he asked, in triumph. &ldquo;Where was I?&rdquo; as he
looked at the piece of paper. &ldquo;Oh, yes: &lsquo;strikes
the hours and half-hours. The undersigned will
give it back for their small nickel-plated alarm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
clock, rather battered, but still in the ring.
Doesn&rsquo;t strike at all.&rsquo; How&rsquo;s that, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the end, as he laced his shoe
loosely, for he had bandaged his ankle. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
have it, and I&rsquo;ll put my name down, then you
fellows can go down and stick it up. I&rsquo;m going
to stretch out;&rdquo; and, scribbling his name on the
notice, Tom threw himself on the couch, with due
regard for its age and weakness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix it up,&rdquo; volunteered Phil.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>A CLASH WITH LANGRIDGE</small></h2>


<p>In the meanwhile football practice went on,
and the team seemed to be getting into better
shape, though there was much to be desired. Sam
and Pete did better, though they were uncertain,
and there was much ragged work, both in offensive
and defensive plays, over which coach and captain
shook their heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Randall has got to do better than that,&rdquo; said
Mr. Lighton, &ldquo;if she wants to stay at the head
of the league.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; agreed Kindlings. &ldquo;Bricktop is
coaching Sam all he can, but it needs more than
coaching to make a guard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope for the best,&rdquo; suggested the coach. &ldquo;I
wonder how our freshmen will make out Saturday
against Boxer Hall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll win, of course,&rdquo; declared Dan, energetically.</p>

<p>The game between the two freshmen elevens
of Boxer Hall and Randall was quite an event,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
almost approaching the &rsquo;varsity struggles, and
there was a big crowd on hand at the Boxer Hall
gridiron the following Saturday when the contest
was about to begin. Nearly all of the &rsquo;varsity
squad was present to lend moral and vocal support,
and Bean Perkins was in his element.</p>

<p>It was a hot battle from the very kick-off, and
the two teams fought each other up and down
the field. There was considerable kicking and
open playing, but Randall depended on old-fashioned
football, modified by Mr. Lighton, and
secured the first touchdown. Boxer Hall got one
before the initial half was finished, and then there
was much speculation during the intermission as
to which side would win.</p>

<p>By tremendous efforts, ploughing through the
line, bucking great holes between their opponents,
and by putting up a great defense, Randall succeeded
in getting another touchdown, and a goal
from the field, while Boxer Hall was unable to
score in the last half. It was a glorious victory,
all the more so because Randall had lost the
contest the previous season.</p>

<p>The game was over. There had been cheers
for the winners and losers, and college cries and
songs galore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on over this way,&rdquo; urged Tom to Sid
and Phil, who had sat with him during the game.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
&ldquo;I think I see Madge, Ruth and Mabel. There
are a lot of Fairview girls here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, trust you for seeing the lassies,&rdquo; half-grumbled
Sid, yet he followed, for he had more
than a passing liking for Miss Harrison.</p>

<p>As the trio approached the three girls, who
were standing together on the side lines, Tom
suddenly plucked his companions by their sleeves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; demanded Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Langridge and Gerhart going to speak
to them,&rdquo; said the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Phil, and a red glow suffused
the quarter-back&rsquo;s face as he saw the former bully
of Randall speaking to his sister. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not stand
for that! I don&rsquo;t want Ruth to have anything
to do with him!&rdquo; For Langridge was not the
kind of a chap any fellow would want his sister
to associate with. In times past Langridge had
been quite friendly with Miss Madge Tyler, but
when she had discovered certain things about him,
she had cut his acquaintance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess he&rsquo;s trying to get in with her again,&rdquo;
suggested Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put a stop to that!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil, grimly,
as he strode forward. Then he called peremptorily:
&ldquo;Ruth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His sister looked up, caught his eye, blushed a
little and, with a word to Langridge and Gerhart,
moved off. Her two girl friends followed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
seemed glad of the chance to get away from the
two sportily-dressed lads.</p>

<p>Langridge swung around, and at the sight of
the three lads who, more than any others, had
been instrumental in causing him to leave Randall,
his face turned a dull red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Clinton?&rdquo; he called, sharply.
&ldquo;Do you think your sister is too good to speak
to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He evidently does,&rdquo; sneered Gerhart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you ask me&mdash;I do,&rdquo; replied Phil, calmly,
and then he turned his back on the angry Boxer
Hall students and began to talk to his sister and
her friends, Tom and Sid joining in the conversation,
not without a little sense of embarrassment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, if you think I&rsquo;m going to stand
for being insulted publicly this way, you&rsquo;re mistaken,
Clinton!&rdquo; cried Langridge, hotly. He
strode forward, while Gerhart tried in vain to hold
him back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Phil!&rdquo; cried Ruth, reaching out her hand
to halt her brother, but in an instant he had gone
beyond where she stood. She clasped her hands
in alarm, and Madge and Mabel, with heightened
color, gathered close to her.</p>

<p>Langridge and Phil faced each other with flashing
eyes, and Gerhart stood just behind the former
bully of Randall, looking a bit alarmed, for Langridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
had torn from his grasp with considerable
force.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out, Phil,&rdquo; spoke Sid, in a low voice, but
Langridge heard him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You keep out of this!&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle
with Clinton first, and then if you or Parsons want
anything, you know where you can get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and so do you!&rdquo; declared Tom, stung
by the bully&rsquo;s words. More than once had the
plucky end proved his words, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tom!&rdquo; breathed Madge, and she laid a
gentle hand on his coat sleeve. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t
let them&mdash;fight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom slowly turned his gaze from the flushed
and angry face of Langridge to that of the beautiful
girl at his side. She was pale, but smiled
bravely. It was a tense moment. Phil and the
bully still stood facing each other, neither willing
to give way. A little crowd, attracted by the impending
clash, was approaching.</p>

<p>Tom caught Sid&rsquo;s eye, and the latter, with a
quick motion, indicated that he and Tom must interfere
to prevent an encounter, at least thus publicly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you insulted me,&rdquo; mumbled Langridge,
his fists clenched, as he glared at Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; murmured Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you the truth, in answer to your question,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
retorted the quarter-back. &ldquo;You brought
it on yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why you should consider that my speaking
to your sister was an insult, I can&rsquo;t quite make
out,&rdquo; declared Langridge, with a sneer. &ldquo;Neither
she, Miss Tyler nor Miss Harrison resented it.
But perhaps you consider yourself the knight errant
of all girls. If so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do!&rdquo; interrupted Phil, sharply.
&ldquo;Leave my sister and her friends out of this discussion,
if you please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I don&rsquo;t please,&rdquo; sneered Langridge,
&ldquo;for I assure you that I do not, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil fairly jumped for the bully and Ruth
uttered a little cry. In another instant there would
have been a scene which Phil, in his calmer moments
would have regretted as greatly as any one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>THE BIG CALIFORNIAN</small></h2>


<p>Tom saw what was about to happen, and his
ready hand fell on his chum&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not here! Not now!&rdquo; he whispered into his
ear. &ldquo;Some other time, Phil. Think of your
sister&mdash;of the other girls. A crowd is gathering.
Not now! Not now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil made a motion as if to shake off the restraining
grasp, and then thought better of it. In
the meanwhile, Sid had casually stepped in front
of Langridge. The left half-back motioned to
Gerhart to call aside his chum, and the bully&rsquo;s
crony was only too glad to do this, for he was
somewhat of a coward, and he feared lest he, too,
be entangled in the quarrel which seemed imminent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away, Langridge,&rdquo; advised Sid, in a low
voice. &ldquo;If you want satisfaction later I&rsquo;m sure
our friend will give it to you. But not now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, come on,&rdquo; urged Gerhart, linking his arm
in that of his friend. He swung him around,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and Langridge, with a vindictive look at Phil,
allowed himself to be led away. At the same
time Tom, with a forced laugh, for the benefit
of the crowd, walked Phil to one side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say something!&rdquo; he whispered, hoarsely.
&ldquo;Laugh, Phil, if you don&rsquo;t want to make it unpleasant
for the girls. The people are beginning
to ask questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The quarter-back at once rallied to save the
situation. He clapped Tom on the back, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty good, old fellow! Pretty good.
You must tell that story at the next frat. dinner.
But it was a great game, wasn&rsquo;t it? Now, come
on, Ruth, and we&rsquo;ll all go and have something to
drink. Hot chocolate wouldn&rsquo;t be bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most delightful,&rdquo; chimed in Miss Harrison,
with a grateful look at Sid and Tom, as she gallantly
threw herself into the breach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So good of you,&rdquo; murmured Ruth, smiling,
though her paleness belied her meaningless words,
and she was trembling.</p>

<p>The three lads, each walking beside one of the
girls&mdash;Tom with Ruth, Phil with Madge Tyler,
and Sid with Miss Harrison&mdash;strolled toward the
entrance gate of the football field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobly done, old chap,&rdquo; whispered Tom.</p>

<p>The crowd began to melt away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought there was going to be a fight,&rdquo; murmured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
one disappointed lad, whose &ldquo;loud&rdquo;
clothes bespoke his sporting proclivities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was,&rdquo; answered a companion, &ldquo;only
something stopped it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are those three fellows?&rdquo; asked another
lad from Boxer Hall&mdash;a freshman evidently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know the three inseparables?&rdquo;
inquired the &ldquo;sport.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not to know
them argues yourself unknown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls were more at their ease now, and
Phil, who had started what had so nearly been
trouble, did not refer to it, to the great relief of
his sister. Really, the interview with Langridge
had been unsought on the part of the girls, and
they had done their best to avoid speaking to
him, without being downright insulting.</p>

<p>Miss Tyler and Miss Harrison began a series
of gay nothings, and Ruth was soon drawn into
the conversation, to which Tom, Phil and Sid
contributed their share.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell us about the clock and chair mystery,
boys,&rdquo; begged Ruth, when they had left the place
where they had partaken of hot chocolate. &ldquo;Phil
said something about it, but I had to drag it out
of him like a lawyer cross-questioning a reluctant
witness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! Listen to Portia!&rdquo; cried Madge. &ldquo;But
we should dearly love to hear about the queer
happenings.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereupon the three young men together and
separately, told of the disappearance of their beloved
chair, the missing clock, the appearance
of the mahogany timepiece, and their ineffectual
search for clews.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if Langridge didn&rsquo;t have a hand in it,
I&rsquo;ll eat my hat, saving the presence of you ladies,&rdquo;
declared Tom. &ldquo;Only I can&rsquo;t get Sid or Phil to
agree with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about, eating your hat?&rdquo; demanded the
quarter-back. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us interfere with that
pleasure. Go ahead. If yours isn&rsquo;t enough, you
may have a couple of bites out of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know what I mean,&rdquo; declared Tom,
in a little huff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you mean about Langridge, I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> agree
with you,&rdquo; put in Sid. &ldquo;He never had his finger in
this pie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right, Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil, and then the discussion
started all over again, and lasted until
the girls declared that they must return to Fairview.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of it, fellows?&rdquo; asked
Tom, some time later, when the three chums
were on their way back to their rooms. &ldquo;Think
Langridge will start anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was Sid&rsquo;s opinion. &ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;ll be
glad to let well enough alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you think I didn&rsquo;t do exactly right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to make the break I did,&rdquo; ventured Phil, &ldquo;but I
couldn&rsquo;t stand it to see him talking to Ruth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, either!&rdquo; declared Tom, so heartily that
the other two laughed, and the little strained feeling
that had manifested itself passed away.</p>

<p>As they strolled down the corridor the three
lads nearly ran into a youth who turned the corner
of the hall suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, strangers!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
in a full, rich voice. &ldquo;I sure didn&rsquo;t see you coming,
nor yet hear you. I guess I&rsquo;m in the wrong
pew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom and his chums saw confronting them a
tall, well-built lad&mdash;big would be the more proper
term, for he was big in every way. Six feet if
he was an inch, and broad in proportion. He
stood regarding them without a trace of embarrassment,
a stranger in a strange place, evidently.</p>

<p>For a moment Tom had a wild idea that the
mystery of the chair and clock was about to be
solved. He had not seen the youth before, and
he might be a clever thief who had sneaked into
the college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you want?&rdquo; asked Phil, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who are you?&rdquo; demanded Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; went on the stranger.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just arrived at Randall, and Mr. Zane
showed me to my room. I left it and went outside,
but when I came in again, either someone took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
my apartment, or, as I said, I&rsquo;m on the wrong
front stoop. Simpson is my name, Frank Simpson.
I&rsquo;m from California, and I&rsquo;ve been attending Leland
Stanford University, but father&rsquo;s business
called him East permanently, and so I decided to
come to Randall. I&rsquo;ve just arrived,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simpson,&rdquo; murmured Phil, wondering where
he had heard the name before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a capital &lsquo;S&rsquo;,&rdquo; put in the strange student,
with a whimsical smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re the fellow Jerry Jackson was speaking
of,&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, recalling the Jersey
twin&rsquo;s reference to some new students who were
due to arrive at Randall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much obliged to Mr. Jackson, whoever he
may be,&rdquo; spoke the tall youth, &ldquo;but I haven&rsquo;t the
honor of his acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll soon know him,&rdquo; added Sid. &ldquo;And
so you&rsquo;re from California, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I think I&rsquo;m going to like it here,&rdquo;
was the response. &ldquo;They tell me there was a
Freshman football game to-day. Did our boys
win?&rdquo; he asked, eagerly. &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m making
myself right at home, calling &rsquo;em <i>our</i> boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do,&rdquo; declared Tom, who,
somehow, felt a sudden liking for the stranger.
&ldquo;Are you interested in football?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I played&mdash;some&mdash;at Stanford,&rdquo; was the modest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
reply, &ldquo;but I suppose it&rsquo;s too late to get on
the team here. You&rsquo;re all made up, I hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Made and unmade,&rdquo; murmured Tom, in a low
voice. &ldquo;Jove!&rdquo; he added under his breath, as he
took in the proportions of the big Californian,
&ldquo;what a guard or tackle he&rsquo;d make!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>A NEW COMPLICATION</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, hang it all!&rdquo; burst out Phil Clinton, as
he tossed aside his trigonometry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; inquired Tom, looking
up from his Latin prose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got the dink-bots?&rdquo; was Sid&rsquo;s gentle
question, as he kept on carefully mounting a butterfly,
one of the specimens he had captured during
the summer, and had laid aside until a leisure moment
to care for properly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but I can&rsquo;t get my
mind down to study,&rdquo; went on the quarter-back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never could,&rdquo; declared Tom, fortifying
himself behind the sofa in case Phil should turn
violent.</p>

<p>It was the evening after the Freshman game,
and the three chums were in their study, after
the meeting with the big Californian, as Frank
Simpson had at once been dubbed. He had been
directed to his room, which was on the floor above
the apartment of our heroes, and he had gone off
thanking them warmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the main trouble?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing in particular; but I guess I&rsquo;m
thinking of too many other things. There&rsquo;s that
little run-in I had with Langridge, seeing the game
to-day, worrying about the clock and chair mystery,
and wondering how our eleven is going to
make out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough to drive you to&mdash;cigarettes,&rdquo; admitted
Tom. &ldquo;But I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ll tell you what let&rsquo;s do,&rdquo; broke in Sid.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s invite that Simpson chap down here. He
must be sort of lonesome, being a stranger here.
I saw him going off to his room after grub, and
none of the fellows spoke to him. Now, Randall
isn&rsquo;t that kind of a college. True, we don&rsquo;t know
much about him, but he looks the right sort. It
won&rsquo;t do any harm to have him down here and
talk to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure not,&rdquo; agreed Phil at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; declared Tom. &ldquo;Shall we all go
and invite him down, as a committee of three, or
will one be enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, one,&rdquo; replied Phil. &ldquo;You go, Tom, you&rsquo;re
the homeliest. Have it as informal as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like your nerve!&rdquo; exclaimed the end. &ldquo;However,
I will go, for I like Simpson. I wish he
was on the eleven. Wonder if he was any good
at Stanford?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never heard of him setting the goal posts on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
fire,&rdquo; came from Sid, &ldquo;but you never can tell. If
he has any football stuff in him Lighton will bring
it out. We can tell Simpson to get into practice,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Randall needs just such material as he looks
to be,&rdquo; went on Tom, as he arose to go to the
room of the Californian. &ldquo;I rather hope he makes
the &rsquo;varsity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank Simpson very much appreciated the invitation
he received, and a little later he was
accorded a seat of honor on the sofa, and made
to feel at home by our heroes, who plied him
with questions about his native State, and what
sort of a college Leland Stanford was. The newcomer
at Randall answered genially, and, in turn,
wanted to know many things. Particularly he
was interested in football, and in response to
Tom&rsquo;s urging that he practice, he said that he
would.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fellows have quite a place here,&rdquo; went
on Frank, as his gaze roved admiringly about the
room. &ldquo;Quite a tidy shack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see the best part of it,&rdquo; spoke Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; inquired Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our old easy chair was mysteriously taken,
and in place of a clock whose tick, while an aggravation,
made us all feel at home, that timer was
left in its place,&rdquo; remarked Phil, before his chum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
had a chance to answer. And then the story of
the queer happenings was told again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s rigging you, I guess,&rdquo; was the
opinion of the lad from Stanford. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
let &rsquo;em see that I was worried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re not, but we&rsquo;d like to get our chair
back,&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something like that happened out in our college,
when I was a freshman,&rdquo; went on the newcomer,
who, it developed, was in the Randall
sophomore class. &ldquo;We fellows missed things
from our rooms and made quite a row about it,
thinking a thief was busy. But it developed that
there was a secret society of seniors whose sworn
duty it was to furnish up their meeting-room with
something taken from every fellow&rsquo;s apartment
in the college. Jove! But those fellows had a
raft of stuff, every bit of it pilfered, and when
we got next to it we stripped their meeting place
as bare as a bone, and got our things back. Maybe
that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happened here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible,&rdquo; admitted Phil, &ldquo;but we haven&rsquo;t
heard of any senior secret society like that. It&rsquo;s
worth looking up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door, and Holly
Cross and Dutch Housenlager entered. They
were introduced to Frank, and the congenial little
party of lads talked of various matters, mostly
football, until the striking of the new clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
warned them that it was time for the proctor to
begin his nightly rounds of discovery.</p>

<p>Frank Simpson began football practice with the
scrub eleven the next day, and though he was
sneered at by some, Tom and his friends on the
&rsquo;varsity at once saw that the Californian knew
the game. Mr. Lighton did not have to have his
attention called to the work of the newcomer,
for he picked him out at once, and kept his eyes
on him during the warm-up play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder but what there&rsquo;d be &rsquo;varsity
material there,&rdquo; the coach confided to the captain
after the practice game was over, when the
scrub had rolled up two touchdowns against their
mates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The land knows we need something to brace
us up,&rdquo; replied Kindlings, somewhat despondently.
&ldquo;Sam Looper is getting worse instead of better.
They tore big holes through him to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Lighton. &ldquo;And
what will happen when Boxer Hall tackles us can
be more than imagined, unless there&rsquo;s a big improvement.
But I&rsquo;m going to watch Simpson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The big Californian was of a genial temperament,
and he endeavored to make friends with
his fellows on the scrub, but, somehow or other,
they rather resented his advances, and turned the
cold shoulder to him. Hurt, but not despairing,
Frank &ldquo;flocked by himself&rdquo; for a few days. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
was becoming known as a &ldquo;dig,&rdquo; for he did well
in the classroom.</p>

<p>Then Tom, and his two mates, seeing how the
wind was blowing, made a special point to invite
the newcomer to their room more frequently.
They took him to their bosoms, and their warm
welcome more than made up for the coldness on
the part of some of the others.</p>

<p>It was not an intentional slight by those who
did not welcome Simpson. Don&rsquo;t get that impression,
for there was a warm school spirit at Randall.
Only, somehow, it took a little longer for a
stranger to make friends, coming in after the term
had started, than it did before. Then, too, the
fact that he had not passed his freshman year
there was a bit against him. But Tom, Phil and
Sid minded this not in the least, and soon Frank
was made to feel quite at home, for which he was
duly grateful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty white of you fellows, to treat me
this way, like a friend and a brother,&rdquo; he said,
feelingly, one night, after a session in the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, get out! Why shouldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; demanded
Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; spoke Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, lots of fellows wouldn&rsquo;t go to the
trouble, and I appreciate it,&rdquo; went on the lad from
the Golden Gate. &ldquo;All I want now is to make
the &rsquo;varsity, and I&rsquo;ll be happy!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be nearer getting on than you think,&rdquo;
murmured Phil, for in practice that day Snail
Looper had done worse than ever, while Frank
was a tower of strength to the scrub, which had
almost beaten the first team.</p>

<p>In spite of their work on the gridiron, our
heroes did not forget to look for clews to the
missing chair and clock. Only none developed,
search and pry about as they did. The big Californian
helped them by suggestions, but there
proved to be nothing in his theory of a purloining
secret society, and Tom and his chums did not
know which way to turn next.</p>

<p>The date for the game with Newkirk was drawing
closer, and practice was correspondingly
harder. It was one afternoon, following a gruelling
hour on the field, that as Tom, his two chums,
and Frank were walking toward the gymnasium,
they saw several members of the faculty entering
the house of President Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello! What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something, evidently,&rdquo; answered Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have any of you fellows been cutting up?&rdquo;
asked Sid, with suspicious looks at his companions.
They quickly entered denials.</p>

<p>Clearly there was something extraordinary in
the meeting that had evidently been called, for the
professors wore grave looks as they entered the
residence of the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope none of the &rsquo;varsity crowd has been
misbehaving himself, and will get laid off the
team,&rdquo; went on Phil, who felt that he carried the
weight of the eleven on his shoulders. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
in bad enough shape now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes Wallops, let&rsquo;s ask him,&rdquo; suggested
Tom, and when the messenger approached they
plied him with questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know what it is,&rdquo; answered
Wallops, &ldquo;but it is something important and serious,
so I heard Mr. Zane saying to Professor
Tines, when he gave him word about the meeting.
It has something to do with the title to the land
on which the college is built. I believe some one
has laid claim to it, on account of a cloud on the
title, but I really don&rsquo;t understand legal terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that Randall College is in danger
of losing some of the property?&rdquo; gasped Phil, as
he looked around at the fine campus, the athletic
field, and the group of buildings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something like that,&rdquo; went on the messenger.
&ldquo;I heard Mr. Zane say the land might be
taken by the heirs of some old man who once had
a claim on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what would happen if he could make
good his claim?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I suppose the heirs could
say the college was theirs, being built on their
ground, or they could tear it down. But I don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
rightly know,&rdquo; concluded Wallops. &ldquo;Probably it
will be known after the meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More trouble for old Randall!&rdquo; groaned Tom,
as he and his chums watched the gathering of the
solemn professors.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>THE MISSING DEED</small></h2>


<p>Bad news, they say, travels fast, and certainly
it must have made a record trip throughout the
length and breadth of Randall that afternoon.</p>

<p>Tom and the others had scarcely changed from
their football togs into ordinary clothes before
half a score of their fellows demanded to know
if they had heard the rumors that were flying
around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We sure have,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;How much
truth is there in them, Jerry Jackson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the Jersey twin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We only heard as much as you did,&rdquo; echoed
his brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prexy will make an announcement at chapel
to-morrow morning, if there&rsquo;s anything in it,&rdquo; declared
Dutch Housenlager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I wish it was chapel time now,&rdquo; murmured
Phil. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this suspense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me either,&rdquo; declared Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s one consolation,&rdquo; put in Frank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Simpson. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s got anything to do with the law
there&rsquo;s no present danger that the college will be
torn down&mdash;not before the football season is
over, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; demanded Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the law is so slow. If it&rsquo;s a question
of title to land it can go through several courts
before it&rsquo;s definitely decided. I know because my
father&rsquo;s a lawyer, and he&rsquo;s had several cases of
disputed titles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s something in that,&rdquo; declared Phil.
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t like to think of old Randall being in
any kind of danger. It makes me uneasy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The talk became general, and there were many
speculations as to what the trouble really was,
and what the outcome would be. The conversation
continued after our friends had gone to their
room, whither flocked a number of their chums
to discuss the situation. For the time being football
was forgotten, and the trouble of Randall
held the centre of the stage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no use worrying about a bridge,
until you hear the rustle of its wings,&rdquo; said Sid
at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What we fellows need to do is to get out and
make a noise like having some fun,&rdquo; opined Dutch
Housenlager. &ldquo;When the cat&rsquo;s gone on her vacation,
the mice eat bread and cheese, you know.
Proc. Zane is closeted with the bunch of highbrows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
and so what&rsquo;s the matter with cutting up
some?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dutch, I&rsquo;m surprised at you!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom,
reproachfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked the fun-loving
youth, innocently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wanting to skylark at a time like this, just
because the authorities are in <i>statuo quo</i>,&rdquo; went on
Tom. &ldquo;Not on your life, Dutch! It&rsquo;s fun enough
to play some tricks when you&rsquo;re taking chances
on getting caught. Now it would be like taking pie
from a baby in arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; admitted Dutch Housenlager,
contritely. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll defer the operation,&rdquo;
he went on, in solemn tones. &ldquo;I think the patient
will survive until morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seldom had there been such an attendance at
service as greeted Dr. Churchill when he stood on
the platform in the Booker Memorial Chapel the
next morning. The early sun glinted in through
the stained glass windows, and seemed to pervade
the room with a mystic light that added to the
solemnity of the occasion.</p>

<p>The Scriptural selection was from one of the
Psalms of David&mdash;one of those beautiful prose
poems which are such a comfort in times of
trouble. And as the vibrant tones of the venerable
president&rsquo;s voice rose and fell, when he feelingly
spoke the words, it seemed to the boys, careless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and happy-go-lucky as they might be ordinarily,
that a new dignity and depth of appreciation
was theirs.</p>

<p>After the prayer, which was in keeping with
the Bible reading, Dr. Churchill arose, and came
slowly to the edge of the platform. He stood
for a moment, silently contemplating the throng
of earnest young faces raised to his, and then he
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men of Randall,&rdquo; he began, solemnly, &ldquo;we
are facing a crisis in the history of our college.
Men of Randall, it behooves us to meet it bravely,
and with our faces to the enemy. Men of Randall,
we may be at the parting of the ways, and so,
being men together, I speak to you as men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The good doctor paused, and a sound, as of a
great sigh, passed through the assemblage. Usually
when the doctor had any announcement to
make, he addressed the students as &ldquo;young gentlemen.&rdquo;
They felt the change in the appellation
more than any amount of talk would have impressed
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doubtless you have heard rumors of the crisis
in our affairs,&rdquo; went on the president, after taking
off his glasses, slowly wiping them, and replacing
the frames back of his ears, over which the white
locks fell. &ldquo;Whatever you have heard I beg of
you to disregard to this extent, that you do not
repeat it. In evil times words increase trouble. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
will tell you the truth as nearly as I and the gentlemen
associated with me can come at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Randall College, as you know, was built many
years ago. The land was purchased from a fund
left by a gentleman who had the good of the youth
of this land at heart. Other endowments enabled
buildings to be put up. In all these years no hint
of trouble has come to us, but now we are confronting
a fact, not a theory, as your political
science teaches you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The land whereon Randall and the various
buildings stand, yes, where there is laid out the
fields for the pursuit of baseball and football, and
I think I am right in assuming this to be the football
season?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The president paused, and glanced questioningly
at the proctor, whom he evidently took for
an authority on sports. For Dr. Churchill, while
an enthusiastic supporter of every team in the college,
knew rather less about the various terms,
and times of games than the average baby. The
proctor nodded in acquiescence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even the very football field is under suspicion,&rdquo;
continued the president, and there was another
great sigh, mainly from that section of the
chapel where sat Tom and his chums. &ldquo;In fact
the entire ground on which the college is built has
been claimed by outsiders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The facts, in brief, are these: When the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
was purchased there were several persons who had
interests therein. From them releases, in the form
of quit-claim deeds, were obtained, and then it
was thought that the corporation of Randall had
a clear title. Now it develops that a certain Simon
Hess was one of the persons who gave a quit-claim
deed, after being paid for his share in the
land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That deed, I regret to say, can not be found,
and in the absence of it, it is as if it never existed.
Simon Hess is dead, but he left several heirs, and
they are now making a claim against the college.
Perhaps they might not be so eager, were it not
for certain lawyers who are apparently urging
them on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An attempt was made to settle with them
when they made their claim known, but the lawyers
insisted that their clients prosecute their suits, and
so the hope of compromise was abandoned. It
seems that they want the life&rsquo;s blood of our college,
and, as you know, we are not a wealthy institution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yesterday I received from Mr. Franklin Langridge,
the lawyer who represents the claimants,
a demand for a large cash settlement if their claim
was abandoned. I need hardly say that Randall
is in no position to pay a large amount in cash.
I called a meeting of the faculty, and we came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
that conclusion. I have so notified Mr. Langridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the first mention of that name there had
been an uneasy movement among the students. At
its repetition, when it was whispered around that
this was the father of Fred Langridge, the former
bully of the college, the movement became more
pronounced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Langridge,&rdquo; went on the president, when
he was suddenly interrupted by a series of hisses.
Dr. Churchill started. Mr. Zane hurriedly whispered
to him, explaining that it was only the name
of Langridge that thus met with disapprobation.
The venerable president raised his hand for silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men of Randall,&rdquo; he said, solemnly, &ldquo;that
was unworthy of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hissing stopped instantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so our college is in danger,&rdquo; continued
the good doctor, after a pause, &ldquo;but we must face
it bravely. We will not give way to it. We will
meet it like men! We will fight the good fight.
We will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Randall College and Dr.
Churchill!&rdquo; yelled Bean Perkins, leaping to his
feet and forgetting that he was in chapel&mdash;forgetting
that it was a solemn occasion&mdash;forgetting
everything save that he was wrought up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
point of frenzy. &ldquo;Three cheers, and the biggest
tiger that ever wore stripes, fellows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, what a shout there was! Every student
was on his feet in an instant, yelling at the top
of his voice. Even some of the faculty joined in,
and Dr. Emerson Tines was observed to be wildly
waving his hands. How the cheers rang out!
And then the tiger!</p>

<p>Dr. Churchill blew his nose violently, and wiped
his glasses several times, for there was a mist of
tears on them. He tried to speak&mdash;to go on&mdash;but
he was too affected.</p>

<p>Slowly he turned, and walked back to his seat
amid the faculty. And then Bean Perkins did
what forever covered him with glory, wherever,
in after years, the stories of Randall College were
told.</p>

<p>Jumping up on one of the pews, he raised his
hand for silence. Then, in a voice that was singularly
sweet and clear, he started that school song:
&ldquo;<i>Aut Vincere, Aut Mori!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Welled out the strains from hundreds of
throats&mdash;the song of songs&mdash;the song that was
always sung in times of victory, or when the teams
on diamond or gridiron seemed to be putting up
a losing fight&mdash;the song that had snatched many
a victory from defeat.</p>

<p>Forth it rolled, deep-voiced and solemn, sung
in the original Latin, in which it had been composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
years ago by a gifted graduate: &ldquo;<i>Aut Vincere,
Aut Mori!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Either We Conquer, or
We Die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the rallying cry to the battle that confronted
the college.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>THE FIRST GAME</small></h2>


<p>Silence followed what was probably the most
remarkable scene that had ever taken place at
chapel in the history of Randall. A deep, heart-felt
silence, which was almost as impressive as
the unexpected singing had been. Some of the
students were fairly panting from the emotion
which had racked them, for they had been stirred
as they seldom were before.</p>

<p>Slowly Dr. Churchill arose from the chair, and
again approached the edge of the platform. His
voice broke as he spoke a few words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men of Randall, I thank you,&rdquo; he said impressively
and simply. &ldquo;You may rest assured that
nothing will be left undone to save the old college,
which has no more loyal supporters than
yourselves, and, I may add, than the gentlemen
associated with me on the faculty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused a moment, as if he would say more,
and then, with a motion of his hand, dismissed the
assemblage. In silence the students filed out, and
it was not until they were some distance away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the chapel, broken up into little groups, that they
began discussing the situation. Even then it was
in hushed voices, as if the enemies of Randall
might be hiding about, listening for something of
which they could take advantage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wallops wasn&rsquo;t far out,&rdquo; remarked Tom,
who, with Phil, Sid and some other friends, was
walking slowly along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; came from the quarter-back, &ldquo;but
wouldn&rsquo;t it get your Angora, though? To think
of there being a flaw in the title all these years,
and someone only just now taking advantage of
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what can have become of the missing
quit-claim deed?&rdquo; ventured Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No telling,&rdquo; remarked Holly Cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prexy said it was given by a Simon Hess,&rdquo;
went on Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that name before,
somewhere, but I can&rsquo;t recall it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was telling you about our chair having been
in the Hess family,&rdquo; explained Sid. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
remember, I said it was one of the Hess heirlooms
when we bought it of Hatterly, the Senior.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;Fancy that now!
Maybe next they&rsquo;ll be accusing us of having the
missing deed, because we have some of the Hess
property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We <i>haven&rsquo;t</i> got it, you mean,&rdquo; put in Phil.
&ldquo;Our chair is still in a state of <i>non est</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you located that venerable piece of
architecture yet?&rdquo; asked Dutch Housenlager, with
a sly putting forth of his foot, in an effort to trip
Tom. Dutch was always up to some horse-play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t found it, and I guess we&rsquo;re not
likely to,&rdquo; went on the end, as he spoiled the
efforts of Dutch by hitting him a playful blow in
the side. &ldquo;The mystery of the clock is still unexplained.
Our offer to trade back hasn&rsquo;t had any
takers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you fellows make me tired, always talking
about your old relics!&rdquo; broke in Kindlings. &ldquo;You
had much better be considering some new football
plays, or how to help Randall out of the hole
she&rsquo;s in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of the hole some rascally lawyers <i>got</i>
her in, you&rsquo;d better say,&rdquo; corrected Holly Cross.
&ldquo;This trouble never would have developed, if it
hadn&rsquo;t been that some legal sharps stirred it up,
for the hope of a fat fee, I presume.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Langridge&rsquo;s father, of all lawyers!&rdquo; put
in Sid. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have thought that since his son
once went here, he&rsquo;d have had the decency not to
appear in the case, and would have left it for some
one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s doing it on purpose, just because
his son had to leave here,&rdquo; suggested Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder a bit,&rdquo; agreed Captain
Woodhouse. &ldquo;But, say, don&rsquo;t let this trouble get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
on your minds, fellows, so that you can&rsquo;t play
football. We&rsquo;re going up against Newkirk day
after to-morrow, you know, and while we&rsquo;ll probably
roll up a big score against &rsquo;em, we can&rsquo;t take
any chances. Hard practice this afternoon. We
want to wipe up the field with the scrub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be on hand, captain!&rdquo; promised Phil,
and the other players shouted their assents. The
students went to their various studies, still talking
over the scene of the morning, and what it portended.</p>

<p>It was learned, later in the day, that the best
legal talent possible had been engaged to fight the
claim of the Hess heirs for the Randall land, and
that a vigorous search would be made for the
missing quit-claim deed, without which the college
could not prove a clear title to the property.</p>

<p>It also was hinted that Mr. Langridge was not
altogether actuated by purely legal motives in
prosecuting the claim against the college. When
it became known that the father of Garvey Gerhart
was associated with him in the law business,
there were few students who did not believe that
the two men were acting as much out of revenge
because their sons had been forced from Randall,
as from any other motive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it will take some time to get the land
away from the college trustees, even if they lose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the case,&rdquo; explained Frank Simpson, &ldquo;so there
won&rsquo;t be any football games cancelled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was in his uniform, and was walking out
on the field with Tom and the others to the practice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only wish he was going to be in the game
with us against Newkirk instead of the Snail,&rdquo;
mused Tom, as the scrub and &rsquo;varsity lined up.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d stand a better chance to pile up a big
score.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Sam Looper seemed to do better that afternoon,
and was complimented by the coach for
some good tackles he made, as well as for his
ability in breaking through the scrub line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, maybe he won&rsquo;t be so bad,&rdquo; conceded the
captain, hopefully.</p>

<p>The practice was hard and gruelling, but it
brought out a number of weak spots, which were
impressed upon the players, that they might avoid
them. Also some faults in plays were discovered,
and measures taken to correct them.</p>

<p>There was more hard practice the following
day, when the scrub, mainly through the fine playing
of the new member, Frank Simpson, came perilously
near scoring, which they had been prevented
from doing of late. The big Californian
was showing up wonderfully well, and he was
making more friends by his sterling character.</p>

<p>At last came the time for the first regular &rsquo;varsity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
game of the season, and though Newkirk was
considered a sort of second-rate rival, there had
been a marked improvement in her playing of late,
so that the Randallites understood they were to
have no walkover.</p>

<p>The grandstands were filled with a motley
crowd of students, men and women spectators and
pretty girls galore, for nearly all the feminine
contingent of Fairview Institute was on hand,
shrilly cheering, or singing for their favorite
team, and waving the colors of their own college,
intermingled with those of Randall or Newkirk.
It is no exaggeration to say that the yellow and
maroon of Randall predominated, and when
Tom, Phil and Sid looked toward a certain section
of grandstand A, which location had previously
been brought to their attention, they saw
three particularly pretty girls, waving the colors
that meant so much to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madge, Ruth and Mabel are there,&rdquo; announced
Tom, as he followed his mates into the
dressing room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad of it,&rdquo; remarked Phil. &ldquo;It sort of makes
you feel as if you could play better when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your sister is looking on&mdash;or some one&rsquo;s else
sister, eh?&rdquo; broke in Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dry up!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil, as he looked to
the shoulder pads on his canvas jacket.</p>

<p>Out on the gridiron trotted the Newkirk players,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to be received with a salvo of cheers from the
contingent of supporters who had accompanied
them to the Randall grounds.</p>

<p>Then the home team followed, and Bean Perkins
leaped to his feet, wildly brandishing a cane
with the college colors streaming from it, while
he led the cheering, and then added his powerful
voice, as the students broke into the song: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
Going to Wallop &rsquo;Em Now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was announced that the game would be
played in two halves, and when Captain Woodhouse
had conferred with Billy Bardeen, who ran
the Newkirk team, they tossed for choice. Dan
won, and elected to defend the north goal, which
gave him and his men the advantage of a little
wind. Newkirk was to kick off, and when Bardeen
had teed the ball on a little mound of dirt in the
centre of the field, he gave a glance to see if his
men were ready. He gave the signal to the referee,
and that official, after a confirmatory nod
from Captain Woodhouse, blew his whistle.</p>

<p>With a little run, Bardeen planted his toe in
the pigskin, which, straight and true, sailed to
Randall&rsquo;s ten-yard line, being caught by Sid Henderson,
who rushed it back fifteen yards before he
was downed by a fierce tackle by Ed Denton.
There was wild cheering by Perkins and his mates
at this, for it seemed to indicate that Newkirk was
not as strong as she had been rated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Sid slowly arose and planted his foot on the ball
until Holly Cross came up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Line up!&rdquo; yelled Phil, stooping down behind
the big centre, and then he began calling the signal:
&ldquo;Fourteen&mdash;eighty-seven&mdash;one hundred and
six&mdash;forty-two&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He snapped his hands, and the ball came back
to him. Like a flash it was passed to Joe Jackson,
who hit the line for all he was worth, and tore
through for two yards, the Newkirk players seeming
to crumple to pieces under the smashing attack.
There were more cheers at this, and when
Sid Henderson tore off three yards more around
left end, the Randall crowd went wild.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walk it up for a touchdown!&rdquo; yelled Bean
Perkins.</p>

<p>It did look as though the ball might be steadily
advanced up the field for the coveted point, especially
when Pete Backus managed to wiggle
through between left guard and tackle for three
yards more.</p>

<p>But then Newkirk took a brace, and held
against the rushing tactics of her rival, so that,
after getting the ball to within ten yards of the
goal line, Randall tried for a field goal, and lost
because the pigskin struck the post.</p>

<p>Once more Randall, after some scrimmages
during one of which Tom got the ball, began the
rushing tactics, and this time with such fierceness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and energy that inside of five minutes his mates
had shoved Sid Henderson over the line for the
first touchdown. Holly Cross kicked the goal,
and there was a wild riot of cheers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do it; eh, Kindlings?&rdquo; cried
Tom, capering about in delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d ought to have done it twice over in this
time,&rdquo; was the somewhat unsatisfactory response.
&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t look out, they&rsquo;ll score on us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was no danger of that in the first half,
when Randall got another touchdown and goal,
and ended up with a field goal. Then indeed did
Bean Perkins and his cohorts let loose, singing
wildly, though they did not give the &ldquo;Conquer
or Die&rdquo; song. There seemed to be no need for
it.</p>

<p>Newkirk was downcast, but would not give up.
When the second half was resumed, with some
new players lining up against Randall, there was
a moment when it seemed as if her rivals might
menace her goal line, for they rushed the ball up
with disheartening speed. The gains were mostly
made through the unfortunate Sam Looper, who
could not seem to hold, and Bert Bascome, his
tackle, was not playing at his best.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put in Simpson,&rdquo; suggested Tom to Kindlings,
during the time taken out to enable the Newkirk
players to try to get some wind back into their
plucky quarter-back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to put him in over the heads of
men who have been on the scrub all season,&rdquo; objected
the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be worth while,&rdquo; insisted Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; promised Dan, and then play
was resumed. Once more there was a gain
through Sam, and partly because of a fear that
his team would be scored upon, and partly in exasperation,
Dan signalled for Frank to jump in.</p>

<p>There was a joyful look on the face of the big
Californian as he took his place in the line, and
the Snail rather ruefully retired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I need more practice, or&mdash;something,&rdquo;
he admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Principally &lsquo;something,&rsquo;&rdquo; agreed one or two
of the scrub players.</p>

<p>Randall did not exactly need new life, for she
practically had the fight won, but the advent of
Simpson was good. He was a powerful player,
knew the game and its tactics to perfection,
and tore open great holes in the other line,
through which the Randall backs plunged for
substantial gains.</p>

<p>It looked to be easy sailing from now on, and
when several more points had been scored for
Randall, Captain Woodhouse gave orders for
easier playing, as he wanted to save his men. It
nearly cost them something, however, for Joe
Jackson made a fumble, and the ball went to Newkirk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Then, wild to score, those players tore
things loose, and shoved back the Randallites until
it looked as if their goal line would be crossed.</p>

<p>There were many anxious hearts when the ball
was on the twenty-yard mark, and when a trial for
a field goal was made by Newkirk, there were
prayers that it would fail. It did, and then the
leather was quickly booted far enough away to
preclude the possibility of further danger. Before
Newkirk could rush it back five yards, the final
whistle blew, and the first game of the season was
over, with a score of thirty-two to nothing, in
favor of Randall.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>THE HAZING OF SIMPSON</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for the Newkirks!&rdquo; commanded
Bean Perkins, as he swung his gaily decorated
cane, and the yells bore ardent testimony
to the warm feeling felt for a defeated rival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, then, sing: &lsquo;Though We Walloped You,
We Love You&rsquo;!&rdquo; again ordered the cheer leader,
and the song welled forth.</p>

<p>In turn, the Newkirk players cheered for their
opponents, and though there was the bitterness
of defeat in their hearts, none of this betrayed
itself in their yells.</p>

<p>The big crowd scattered from the grandstands,
and, pausing only to get rid of the worst of the
dirt that marked them, our three heroes were soon
walking side by side with Phil&rsquo;s sister and her two
companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, wasn&rsquo;t it great?&rdquo; demanded Miss Tyler,
of Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; cried Ruth Clinton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You certainly rolled up a great score against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
them,&rdquo; was Miss Harrison&rsquo;s contribution to the
trio of opinions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ought to be ashamed of ourselves,&rdquo; declared
Phil. &ldquo;Newkirk isn&rsquo;t in our class, and we
only play them to sort of open the season, and
for practice. Yet they nearly scored on us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we didn&rsquo;t do so bad,&rdquo; was Tom&rsquo;s opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we showed up pretty well, for a team
that had to be patched up after we lost two of our
best players,&rdquo; came from Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you fellows didn&rsquo;t play so awful,&rdquo; conceded
the quarter-back, &ldquo;but if Sam had been in
much longer there&rsquo;d have been a different story.
Pete Backus is making out all right, and his practice
in jumping does him good. But Sam&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simpson helped a lot,&rdquo; said the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, better than I thought he would. He
didn&rsquo;t get gridiron-fright because he was on the
&rsquo;varsity, and his head seems to be about the same
size as before, barring where he got kicked over
the eye,&rdquo; went on Phil. &ldquo;Understand, I&rsquo;m not
knocking the team!&rdquo; he explained quickly, for he
saw the girls looking at him rather oddly. &ldquo;Only
I know, and so does Kindlings and Lighton, that
we&rsquo;ve got to do heaps better when we play Fairview
and Boxer Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, our boys are going to beat you!&rdquo; exclaimed
Miss Tyler, with a mischievous glance at
her chums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have to stick up for Fairview,&rdquo; declared
Phil, &ldquo;but wait and see.&rdquo; He spoke confidently,
yet there was an uneasy feeling in his heart.
Both Boxer and Fairview had stronger teams than
ever before.</p>

<p>The little party walked on, laughing and chatting,
discussing the game at intervals. Phil had
a chance to speak to his sister away from the others
for a moment, and took advantage of the
opportunity, to ask:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Langridge hasn&rsquo;t been pestering you with any
of his attentions lately, has he, Ruth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed he hasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she exclaimed vigorously.
&ldquo;And if he does, Phil, I hope you won&rsquo;t do as you
did before, and make the other girls and me
ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to do that,&rdquo; replied the quarter-back,
&ldquo;only I&rsquo;m not going to have him mixing in
with anyone I care for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I presume that is intended as much for
Madge as it is for me!&rdquo; whispered Ruth, with a
laugh at her brother&rsquo;s blushes, which were visible
under the bronze of his tan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and then the others
came up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what about us, fellows?&rdquo; asked Tom,
when the inseparables were in their room that
night, rather sore and tired from the game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t pat ourselves on the back, and vote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
ourselves gold medals,&rdquo; declared Phil. &ldquo;I hear
that Lighton and old Kindlings are having a consultation,
and there may be a shift of some of the
players.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope he puts me on the other end,&rdquo; exploded
Tom. &ldquo;Bascome didn&rsquo;t support me at all to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t get to feeling that way over it!&rdquo;
cautioned Phil, quickly. &ldquo;That spirit makes a
team go to pieces sooner than anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not going to disrupt the team!&rdquo; declared
Tom. &ldquo;I think, though&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, and appeared to be listening.
Phil sat up on the old sofa, and Sid
looked questioningly toward the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s out in the corridor,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and Tom nodded. &ldquo;Maybe they think
we&rsquo;re out, and they&rsquo;re bringing back our chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or the clock,&rdquo; added Phil.</p>

<p>Tom arose, and tiptoed toward the portal. Before
he reached it, there came a cautious knock
on the panel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we answer it, or pretend we&rsquo;re not in?&rdquo;
he breathed to Sid. Then, without giving the latter
time to answer, a voice called, in a hoarse whisper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Tom, are you and the bunch in there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dutch!&rdquo; spoke Phil, in his natural tone.
&ldquo;Come on in, you old scout! What&rsquo;s all the secret
society business about, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom opened the door, and Billy Housenlager
and Holly Cross stood revealed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yell so!&rdquo; cautioned Dutch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
going to haze that big chap&mdash;what&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;
and he turned to Holly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one from California,&rdquo; explained the centre
rush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Simpson,&rdquo; supplied Tom. &ldquo;Haze him&mdash;what
for? The hazing season is over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for him,&rdquo; explained Dutch, with a chuckle.
&ldquo;You see, he arrived late, and he didn&rsquo;t get what
was coming to him in his freshman year. So he
has to take it now. Do you lads want to be in
on it? If you do, don&rsquo;t make any noise. He&rsquo;s in
a room nearly above you fellows, and he may suspect
something and listen. Want to have some
fun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;do we?&rdquo; and Tom turned to
his companions.</p>

<p>They hesitated a moment, and then Phil, with
a long yawn, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I care to. Too tired. You
fellows can, if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for mine!&rdquo; came quickly from Sid. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got some butterfly specimens to mount.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you fellows make me tired!&rdquo; declared
Dutch, in accents of disgust. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you be
sports? Have some fun! Come on, Tom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; if Phil and Sid are going to stay in to-night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
I&rsquo;ll be with them. You and Holly can go
ahead with the hazing. What&rsquo;s it going to be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t Holly and me alone,&rdquo; explained
Dutch, quickly. &ldquo;A lot of the lads are in on it,
but I suggested you chaps, and now you back out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We never backed in,&rdquo; replied Phil. &ldquo;What
are you going to do to Simpson, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make him swim Sunny River,&rdquo; declared
Dutch, with a chuckle. &ldquo;That is, we&rsquo;re going to
chuck him in, and he&rsquo;ll sink or swim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s taking chances,&rdquo; remarked Tom, quickly.
Somehow, he did not like the idea of hazing
the Californian. They had become too friendly
with him, and Tom was glad his chums had declined
to have a hand in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No chances at all,&rdquo; denied Dutch, vigorously.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be ready with a boat and ropes, in case he
can&rsquo;t swim. But I think he can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean about that part of it,&rdquo; went on
the end. &ldquo;But he may take cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, piffle!&rdquo; cried Holly Cross. &ldquo;If he can&rsquo;t
stand a little wetting he&rsquo;s no good. Besides, it&rsquo;s
warm to-night. Come on, Dutch; we&rsquo;ll go back
and tell the crowd that this bunch is doing its
knitting, and can&rsquo;t come.&rdquo; His voice showed his
contempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell &rsquo;em anything you like,&rdquo; retorted Sid,
&ldquo;and maybe before you&rsquo;re through you&rsquo;ll wish
you&rsquo;d stayed home and learned your lessons.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, rats!&rdquo; fired back Dutch, as he and his
chum went down the corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, maybe there&rsquo;s more truth than poetry in
what you said,&rdquo; commented Phil, after the door
had been closed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About those fellows being sorry. You know,
Simpson is a husky lad, and he may put up more
of a fight than they give him credit for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; cried Tom, suddenly. &ldquo;I believe
you&rsquo;re right, Phil. Those hazers are going to
stack up against trouble, and what&rsquo;s the matter
with us seeing the fun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go down to the river, and watch &rsquo;em throw
Frank in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; cried Phil; and a little later three figures
stole cautiously out, crossed the campus, and
took position well concealed in the now leafless
shrubbery that lined the bank of the stream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Tom,
who had constituted himself a lookout. &ldquo;And
they&rsquo;ve got him, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you tell?&rdquo; demanded Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the biggest fellow in the bunch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d let them take him out of his
room,&rdquo; said Sid. &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s in a blue funk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; declared Tom, quietly.
&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, there&rsquo;ll be some fun soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet, or they&rsquo;ll have the laugh on us if
they see us,&rdquo; cautioned Phil.</p>

<p>The hazers and their victim came nearer, and
the voice of Dutch Housenlager could be heard
declaiming in triumph:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, then, fellows, we&rsquo;ll initiate Mr. Simpson
into the mysteries of the Mermaid Society.
I believe you never were a member of that, were
you, Mr. Simpson?&rdquo; he asked, mockingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never, and I don&rsquo;t want to join now,&rdquo; came
from the big Californian, who seemed strangely
gentle in the hands of his captors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you must, you know,&rdquo; explained Holly
Cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; asserted Bascome. &ldquo;You ought to have
joined as a Freshman, but it&rsquo;s not too late. Is the
water nice and warm, Dutch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I had it heated to seventy-two degrees
this afternoon,&rdquo; replied the fun-loving Housenlager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! You&rsquo;re not going to put me in the
river to-night, are you?&rdquo; demanded Simpson, in
almost tragic tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our intention,&rdquo; mocked Dutch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I may catch cold. You oughtn&rsquo;t to do a
thing like this, boys,&rdquo; pleaded Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, listen to him!&rdquo; mocked Bascome. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
take him back to his mama!&rdquo; and he imitated the
crying of a baby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but, fellows, just consider,&rdquo; begged the
intended victim. &ldquo;I&mdash;I may be drowned,&rdquo; and his
teeth seemed to chatter. &ldquo;Please&mdash;please let me
go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;with bells on!&rdquo; cried Holly, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, I thought you said he&rsquo;d make mincemeat
of &rsquo;em?&rdquo; whispered Phil. &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s a coward!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; admitted Tom, somewhat puzzled.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d beg off like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! It&rsquo;s going to be a fizzle,&rdquo; declared
Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, then, all ready?&rdquo; asked Dutch of his
chums. &ldquo;Get good holds, Holly and Bascome,
and pitch him in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, let me go! Please let me go!&rdquo; begged
Simpson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, cut it out! Be a sport!&rdquo; urged Dutch.
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hurt you, and if you can&rsquo;t swim, we&rsquo;ll
pull you out. You&rsquo;ve got to take your medicine,
and you might as well make up your mind to it.
In with him now, fellows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her go!&rdquo; cried Holly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! Don&rsquo;t! Stop!&rdquo; cried the Californian,
and his voice broke. &ldquo;Please let me go&mdash;consider,
fellows&mdash;you may regret this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Regret nothing!&rdquo; cried Dutch. &ldquo;In with
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a struggle on the bank of the river,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
a series of surprised grunts and exclamations.
Then a dark body went sailing through the air,
and fell with a splash into the stream, while the
shout that followed ended in a gurgle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he goes!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another dark body shot from the bank into the
water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why!&rdquo; gasped Sid. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re hazing
two! Who&rsquo;s the other lad, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second body made a great splash. Then,
before it came to the surface, a third form hurtled
through the air and made a great noise in Sunny
River.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Julius Cæsar&rsquo;s grandmother&rsquo;s cat&rsquo;s kittens!&rdquo;
yelled Tom, careless of who heard him. &ldquo;<a href="#image03">Simpson
isn&rsquo;t in the water at all, fellows!</a> Look! look!
There he is! <a href="#image03">He&rsquo;s throwing the others in!</a> He&rsquo;s
throwing &rsquo;em all in!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">
<a id="image03" name="image03"><img src="images/image03.jpg" width="379" height="600" alt="&ldquo;SIMPSON ISN&rsquo;T IN THE WATER AT ALL, FELLOWS! HE&rsquo;S

<span class="caption">&ldquo;<a href="#Page_118">SIMPSON ISN&rsquo;T IN THE WATER AT ALL, FELLOWS! HE&rsquo;S
THROWING THE OTHERS IN.</a>&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>Phil and Sid stood beside their chum, and gazed
on the scene, which was now partly illuminated
by a half moon. They saw the big Californian
standing in the midst of his would-be hazers,
knocking them down right and left as they rushed
at him, and then, as the hidden ones watched, they
saw the new student grasp Holly Cross around
the waist, and, by a wrestler&rsquo;s trick, toss him over
his back, and into the stream, where three forms
were now swimming toward shore&mdash;three wet,
miserable forms&mdash;three very much surprised lads&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Holly Cross joining them by the most direct
route&mdash;by an air line, so to speak.</p>

<p>Into the water Holly fell with a splash, and
after him went Dutch. Then, seeing their two
ringleaders thus summarily disposed of, the other
hazers ceased their attack on Simpson.</p>

<p>He stood in the midst of the throng, many of
whom were just arising from some terrific left-handers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you that you might be sorry,&rdquo; came in
calm tones from the Californian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the love of mustard, who are you, anyhow?&rdquo;
demanded Bascome, as he crawled dripping
and shivering up on the bank. &ldquo;Are you a
champion strong man, or an elephant trainer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh I spent one vacation traveling with a circus,
and learned to do some throwing tricks,&rdquo;
modestly explained Simpson. &ldquo;And now, gentlemen,
I&rsquo;ll bid you good-evening,&rdquo; and before the
crowd could stop him, had they been so disposed,
he walked away.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how Frank Simpson was hazed. Ask
any old Randall graduates to tell you about it, and
hear what they say.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>THE MIDNIGHT BLAZE</small></h2>


<p>Dripping, shivering, very much chagrined, and
somewhat bruised and lame from their encounter
with the student they had expected to haze so easily,
Holly Cross, Dutch Housenlager and the others
gathered in a little disconsolate group.</p>

<p>Tom, Phil and Sid, hiding in the bushes, and
trying to stifle their snickers of mirth, looked at
the scene, which was thrown into partial relief
by the moon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder how they feel?&rdquo; came from Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them hear you,&rdquo; cautioned Phil, &ldquo;or
they&rsquo;ll vow and declare that we were in on the
game, and knew how it was going to turn out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Sid.</p>

<p>But now someone in the group of hazers spoke.
It was the puzzled and dubious voice of Dutch
Housenlager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, does anyone know what happened?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We must have been struck by a cyclone,&rdquo; declared
Holly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or a waterspout,&rdquo; added Bascome.
&ldquo;Bur-r-r-r-r! But it&rsquo;s cold! I&rsquo;m going to cut for
college!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who said he was easy?&rdquo; demanded Holly
Cross. &ldquo;Was it you, Dutch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who, me? No, I never said such a thing!
Perish the thought! Easy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hardest proposition I&rsquo;ve stacked up
against in a long while,&rdquo; said another, rubbing his
elbow. &ldquo;Jove! how he did hit out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so <i>sudden</i>!&rdquo; commented Dutch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, did you think he was going to send
word on ahead when he was going to land on
you?&rdquo; asked Jerry Jackson. &ldquo;Come on. We&rsquo;ve
had enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too much,&rdquo; added his brother. &ldquo;I suppose
this will be all over Randall in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if I have to tell it,&rdquo; insisted Bascome.
&ldquo;But Simpson may squeal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be justified,&rdquo; asserted another. &ldquo;He
has one on us, all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe he&rsquo;s too square to say anything about
it,&rdquo; spoke Jerry.</p>

<p>And so it proved. The next morning, when the
big Californian met his classmates, there was a
calm smile on his face, but neither by word nor
action did he refer to what had taken place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>But, somehow, the story leaked out. Perhaps
it was because Tom, Phil and Sid could not refrain
from publicly asking Dutch and the others
how the hazing had resulted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you duck Simpson?&rdquo; inquired Tom, as
they were on their way to chapel next morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come and help with the fun,
if you&rsquo;re so anxious to know about it?&rdquo; inquired
Dutch, non-committally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we don&rsquo;t care for baths in the river this
time of the year,&rdquo; remarked Phil, with a laugh,
and then Dutch knew that the story was known,
though Tom and his two chums said nothing about
having been concealed where they had a grandstand
view of the whole performance.</p>

<p>There were now busy days at Randall, for football
was in full sway. As a result of the Newkirk
game, several shifts were made by coach
and captain, and hard practice was called for.
The California lad was given a chance on the
regular against the scrub, and there was talk that
he would permanently replace Sam Looper. It
was felt that Randall had not done herself much
credit thus far on the gridiron, and there were
many anxious hearts in consequence. But the
members of the eleven made up their minds to
do or die, and they went against the scrub so
fiercely that several members of that unfortunate
contingent had to go to the hospital for repairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
or else report disabled. Then the coach and captain
smiled grimly, and were not so worried about
the result of the Fairview and Boxer Hall games.</p>

<p>It was practice, practice, practice, early and
late, until some of the members of the &rsquo;varsity
felt like falling on the exacting Mr. Lighton and
tearing him limb from limb. But they knew it
was for their good, and that they needed it.</p>

<p>Our three friends were in their room one evening,
talking of various matters, and incidentally
speculating on the loss of their clock and chair.
They had not had much time, of late, on account
of football, to seek for clews, and they had about
given up hope of recovering their possessions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it will soon be time to go up against
Fairview,&rdquo; remarked Tom, as he looked critically
at a big leather patch he had sewed on the shoulder
of his canvas jacket. &ldquo;I do hope we win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here, old man,&rdquo; added Phil, who was
inspecting a new leather helmet he had just purchased.
&ldquo;I think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a knock on the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; cried Sid, who was trying to study,
but making little headway at it. Frank Simpson
entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you fellows are nice and cozy here,&rdquo; he
remarked. &ldquo;Am I intruding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit! Come on in, and make yourself
at home!&rdquo; called Tom, heartily, shoving a pile of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
miscellaneous articles off one end of the sofa, to
make room for the visitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just sit down sort of easy, please,&rdquo; cautioned
Sid, as he motioned toward the couch. &ldquo;One of
the bottom boards is loose, and it may come down,
especially&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I&rsquo;m not exactly a featherweight,&rdquo; finished
Frank. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful. I got through with my
stuff, and didn&rsquo;t have anything to do, so I thought
I&rsquo;d drop in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we live by the river; when you&rsquo;re down
that way, drop in,&rdquo; said Phil, and there was a
laugh at the joke and reference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see you fellows out there,&rdquo; remarked
the lad from the West, with a motion of his head
toward the stream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we had another engagement,&rdquo; remarked
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking of engagements, reminds me of
something!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil, pulling a note from
his pocket. &ldquo;Ruth wrote me yesterday to come
over to Fairview to-night, and bring you fellows.
There&rsquo;s some sort of doings&mdash;giving a Greek
play, or something like that, and a feed after it.
I forgot all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;re a nice one!&rdquo; cried Tom, jumping
up and looking at the new clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say yes!&rdquo; added Sid. &ldquo;Is it too late
to go now?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess not,&rdquo; drawled Phil. &ldquo;If you fellows
think we can escape the eagle eye of Proc. Zane,
I&rsquo;m willing, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure we are!&rdquo; cried Phil and Tom, eagerly.
&ldquo;We can pull on our best duds, and catch the next
trolley. Zane can go hang! I guess we can slip
in all right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;d better be off then,&rdquo; spoke Simpson,
as he arose to go. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t any too
much room to get dressed, all three at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; begged Phil. &ldquo;That is go and
get togged up, and come back. Go along with
us over to Fairview. My sister said she&rsquo;d like
to meet you. I was telling her about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean it?&rdquo; asked the Californian earnestly,
for he liked social pleasures, and he had
not met any girls, as yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, come along!&rdquo; urged Tom and Sid. &ldquo;We
can fix you up with a girl, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kind of you,&rdquo; murmured Frank. &ldquo;I believe
I will go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little later, the four caught a trolley car for
Fairview Institute, where they were met by Phil&rsquo;s
sister and the other young ladies, who were glad
to see them. There was a little amateur theatrical,
followed by a dance and supper, and Frank
Simpson was made to feel very much at home, for
the girls took to him at once.</p>

<p>It was long past midnight when our four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
friends alighted from the car, and stood for a
moment, before starting toward their college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do if we&rsquo;re caught by Zane?&rdquo;
asked Tom, for there was every likelihood of that
happening. They had known it all the while, but
did not like to think of it when the fun was at
its height.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he nabs us, we&rsquo;ll have to put up with it,&rdquo;
said Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy enough to say,&rdquo; commented Sid, &ldquo;but
you know Prexy made quite a talk about it the
other day, and said that anyone who was caught
out late would be severely dealt with. It might
mean being barred off the team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jove! You don&rsquo;t want that to happen,&rdquo; remarked
Frank. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there some back way we
can sneak in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proc. Zane knows &rsquo;em all,&rdquo; asserted Tom.
&ldquo;We might try it around by the chapel, though.
He isn&rsquo;t there quite so often as he is around the
court and campus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; urged Phil, grimly. &ldquo;Might as
well be killed for a lobster as a crab.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stole silently forward, looking cautiously
around for a sight of the proctor. They had almost
reached the chapel, and were hoping that the
remainder of the way would be clear, when Tom,
who was in advance, suddenly uttered a hiss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; whispered Phil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Zane&mdash;right ahead there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pausing in the shadows, they peered forward.
There stood the proctor directly in the path they
must cross to get into college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just our luck!&rdquo; groaned Sid, dismally.</p>

<p>They hesitated a moment, not knowing what
to do. To be caught, just after the president&rsquo;s
solemn warning, might mean severe punishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Tom, and then Frank
Simpson, who was a little in the rear, suddenly
uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows, look!&rdquo; he called, in a hoarse whisper.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Startled, they looked to where he pointed.
Through the windows of the chapel could be seen
little tongues of flame, leaping up inside. The
building was ablaze.</p>

<p>For a moment, the boys did not know what to
do. Then Tom called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows! We&rsquo;ve got to put that
out! There are extinguishers right in the vestibule,
and we can break down the door. Lively!
We&rsquo;ve got to fight the blaze, and give the alarm!
Ring the bell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They needed no other urging. Without another
glance at the proctor, who had turned back
toward the college, the four lads rushed silently
toward the chapel. It was the work of but a moment
for their sturdy shoulders to break in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
outer door. Then, catching up several chemical
extinguishers, they sprang in through the swinging
inner portals. There was a lively blaze in the
floor, just over the furnace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douse it! Douse it!&rdquo; yelled Tom, making a
jump for it. &ldquo;Someone ring the bell! Maybe we
can&rsquo;t control it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that!&rdquo; yelled Simpson, and a moment
later the deep, solemn tones of the great bell
boomed out on the midnight air, while the hungry
tongues of fire leaped higher and higher.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>ANOTHER CLEW</small></h2>


<p>With a hissing sound, the chemical streams
from the extinguishers spurted upon the blaze.
The fire died down around the edges of the big
hole that had been burned in the floor, but in the
centre there was hot flame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can we get it under?&rdquo; panted Sid, who, having
emptied one extinguisher&mdash;a small one&mdash;ran
after another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to!&rdquo; declared Phil, trying to shield
his face from the fierce heat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we can only keep it down until the fellows
come with the hose, we&rsquo;ll do all right,&rdquo; gasped
Tom, choking from the smoke. There was a
high pressure water service maintained at the college,
hose being connected with a big tank, for the
buildings were so far from town that the fire
department could not easily get there.</p>

<p>Again and again the alarm boomed out from
the big bell, rung by the vigorous arms of the Californian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
The others kept playing the streams on
the fire, retreating as it got hotter, and rushing
in on it as they gained a momentary advantage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they ever coming?&rdquo; gasped Tom. The
college lads had formed an amateur fire brigade,
and had frequent drills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got to&mdash;pretty soon!&rdquo; choked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo; cried Frank, and he hastened
down from the organ loft, where he had
been pulling on the bell rope, catching up an extinguisher
as he came. Soon he was adding his
stream to the others.</p>

<p>Outside could be heard excited yells and shouts,
and the rumble of the hand hose carts as the students
rushed them toward the chapel.</p>

<p>In a short time Tom and his chums were being
assisted by scores of their mates, who, in all sorts
of nondescript garments, formed a strange contrast
to our four heroes, in their immaculate dress
suits&mdash;no, not immaculate any longer, for they
were dripping from the chemicals, they were dirty
and smoke begrimed, and Tom and Sid&rsquo;s garments
were scorched in several places by the
sparks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, did you fellows stop to tog up before you
came to the fire?&rdquo; demanded Holly Cross hoarsely,
as he directed a stream of water into the very
heart of the blaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered Tom, for he saw Proctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Zane coming up with two pails of water to
dash on the embers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Holly, and Sid
quickly stopped him with a punch in the ribs.</p>

<p>The fire, which had been discovered soon after
it broke out, could not stand the combined assault
of the water and chemicals, and, soon after the
arrival of the student brigade, it was practically
extinguished. It had started from an overheated
flue, and had burned quite a hole in the floor, but,
aside from that damage, the destruction of some
pews, cushions and hymn books, the loss was
comparatively slight. The valuable stained glass
windows had not been harmed, though some of
the delicate fresco work on the side walls was
smoke-begrimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess that&rsquo;s out,&rdquo; remarked Dutch
Housenlager, as he looked down into the basement
through the burned hole in the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And very efficient work you young gentlemen
did, too,&rdquo; complimented the proctor. &ldquo;If it had
gotten much more headway, the chapel would
have been consumed. May I ask who discovered
the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s hesitation. Our friends
realized what it might mean to tell just <i>how</i> they
had discovered it. Their chums, among whom
the story had quickly circulated, kept silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard the alarm bell ring, and I jumped up,&rdquo;
said Jerry Jackson, innocently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; echoed his brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who rang the bell?&rdquo; the proctor wanted to
know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could the heat waves have done it?&rdquo; suggested
Professor Newton, who was much interested
in science. &ldquo;It is possible,&rdquo; and he looked
up in the direction of the belfry, and shivered
slightly, for he was only partly dressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rang the bell,&rdquo; admitted Frank Simpson, in
a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, then we have to thank you for discovering
the fire and giving the alarm,&rdquo; went on the
proctor. &ldquo;It was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all discovered the blaze at the same time,&rdquo;
remarked Tom, desperately, and he indicated his
companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Sid and Phil. They
made up their minds that they were in for it now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you saw it from your window, I presume,&rdquo;
went on Mr. Zane, &ldquo;and you came
out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, he seemed to realize
that the quartette were attired in dress-suits&mdash;wet,
bedraggled, chemical-marked and scorched evening
clothes&mdash;but still dress-suits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ah, er&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were coming home from a dance over at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Fairview,&rdquo; said Phil, doggedly, &ldquo;and we saw the
blaze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; exclaimed the proctor, illuminatingly,
and then, unconsciously perhaps, he looked at his
watch, and noted the lateness of the hour. &ldquo;You
four young gentlemen will call at my office to-morrow&mdash;this
morning,&rdquo; he hastily corrected
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Tom, with a grim setting
of his jaw.</p>

<p>An examination showed that there were no
sparks left, and the students were ordered to return
to their rooms. The janitors were sent for,
to remain on guard and place boards over the hole
in the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think he has nerve, to tell us to
report to him, after what we did?&rdquo; asked Tom,
when, following a rather restless night, he and
his chums were on their way to services the next
morning. The chapel was not so badly burned,
but that it could be used.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zane? Oh, he&rsquo;s <i>all</i> nerve!&rdquo; declared Sid. &ldquo;I
almost wish we&rsquo;d let it burn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up, you anarchist!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
take our medicine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was none to take. The proctor met
them on their way to chapel, and smiled as genially
as was possible for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you need not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
report at my office. Personally, I wish to thank
you for the service you rendered to Randall College
last night&mdash;or, rather, this morning,&rdquo; and
he smiled grimly. &ldquo;Had it not been for you, we
should have had no chapel in which to worship
to-day. I thank you most sincerely,&rdquo; and then
Proctor Zane did an unheard-of thing. He shook
hands with Tom and his chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you know about that?&rdquo; gasped
Phil, when the proctor had passed on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say a word about our being out
late,&rdquo; came from Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pinch me&mdash;I think I&rsquo;m dreaming!&rdquo; begged
Tom, but they were all too interested in other
matters to comply with his request.</p>

<p>Dr. Churchill referred to the fire in his remarks
that morning, and the words of praise he bestowed
on our heroes made them wish they were
sitting over the hole in the floor, that they might
sink through out of sight, and so hide their
blushes.</p>

<p>Dutch Housenlager started to whistle, &ldquo;See,
the Conquering Hero Comes,&rdquo; when he saw the
four approaching, but Tom upset him with a quick
tackle, and Dutch subsided.</p>

<p>The fire and football furnished fruitful topics
for conversation among the students for some
days to come, so much so that our heroes had little
time to think about their missing chair and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
clock, until an unexpected happening brought the
matter forcibly to their attention again.</p>

<p>They had been out together to a meeting in
the gymnasium one night, and on their return,
Phil, who was ahead, had some trouble opening
the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of you fellows left your key in it when
you went out,&rdquo; he said, as he removed it, and inserted
his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; asserted Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me either,&rdquo; declared Sid. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; added the end.</p>

<p>Phil said nothing until he had entered the room,
followed by his chums. Then, turning on the
light, he examined the key he had taken from the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows, look here!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
a clew to our mysterious visitor and thief. This
key is a false one, and has been filed down from
some other kind. This thing is getting serious.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>A CRASH IN THE GALE</small></h2>


<p>Curiously, Phil&rsquo;s chums crowded close to him,
looking over his shoulder at the odd key. As he
had said, it was one apparently filed down from
a larger one of different pattern, so that it would
open their door.</p>

<p>And fit their lock it did, as they soon demonstrated,
for, though crude in finish, it threw back
the catch as easily as did one of their own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worse and more of it!&rdquo; murmured Phil, as
he tried the key. &ldquo;The fellow, whoever he is,
must have been just going in our room when we
came along the corridor, and frightened him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case, we ought to have seen him go
past us down the stairs,&rdquo; said Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he could use the back flight, that goes
down into the janitors&rsquo; apartments,&rdquo; suggested
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; cried Sid. &ldquo;I have it. Maybe he was
here some time ago, and when he went out, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
forgot his key. Let&rsquo;s look and see if he took
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sofa&rsquo;s here, at any rate,&rdquo; spoke Tom,
with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;But maybe something else
is gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are too many &lsquo;may-bees&rsquo; for this time
of the year,&rdquo; declared Phil. &ldquo;The fellow might
have run away as we came up; he might have
taken his time ransacking our rooms, for we were
long enough in the gym; he may be here now;
he may have brought back our chair and alarm
clock&mdash;only he hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he added, after a quick
glance about the room. &ldquo;But, as I said, what&rsquo;s
the use of speculating on what <i>might</i> be. We&rsquo;ve
got to get busy and solve this puzzle. We&rsquo;ve got
some sort of a clew in this key.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much, though,&rdquo; from Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think a lot,&rdquo; asserted Phil. &ldquo;In the first
place, it shows that it&rsquo;s been made by an amateur,
and by someone who knows a little about making
keys. Therefore, as we say in geometry, we must
look for a fellow who knows how to use a file
and a hack saw, and who understands locks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there any such in college?&rdquo; demanded Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There may be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s put it up to Zane,&rdquo; suggested Tom.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s friendly with us now, on account of the
fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil, quickly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s work it
out ourselves. I believe we can do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Sid wanted to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By keeping our eyes open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been doing that a long time, and
haven&rsquo;t gotten any nearer to the mystery than we
were at first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because we didn&rsquo;t look in the right direction,&rdquo;
spoke Phil. &ldquo;It has narrowed down
now&mdash;the inquiry has, I mean. Before, we had
to suspect every fellow in college. Now we need
only look for one who has a mechanical turn of
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frank Simpson has!&rdquo; spoke Sid, quickly. &ldquo;I
saw him making a new kind of cleat for his football
shoes the other day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a hot detective!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil, with
a laugh. &ldquo;Our clock and chair were taken before
Simpson came here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Sid, ruefully. &ldquo;I wonder
if the unknown visitor did anything to our new
clock?&rdquo; he went on, as he walked over to examine
the timepiece. &ldquo;Perhaps he left a note of
explanation in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was nothing, and the clock chimed
out the time as cheerfully as ever, as though urging
the new owners to never mind the mystery,
since they had a better recorder of the hours than
before. But the boys wanted their first love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Our heroes were up early the next morning, to
indulge in a practice run with the football squad&mdash;a
little jaunt along the river, proposed by the exacting
coach, with the idea of improving the wind
of his men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jove! but it&rsquo;s getting cold!&rdquo; remarked Tom,
as rosy and glowing with health, he and his mates
turned into the gymnasium for a shower, and vigorous
rub before breakfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Regular football weather,&rdquo; agreed Sid.
&ldquo;Well, I feel as if I could tackle Boxer Hall and
Fairview together now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep on feeling that way,&rdquo; urged the coach,
grimly, as he passed by. &ldquo;We all need it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An unexpected storm blew up that night, putting
a stop to practice on the gridiron, and the
squad had to be content with indoor work. The
weather grew worse, and by night there was a gale
blowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old King Winter isn&rsquo;t far off, by the sound
of that,&rdquo; remarked Tom, who, with his chums,
was in the room, studying or making a pretense of
so doing. He arose, and, going to the window,
where Sid was, looked out. There came a sharp
dash of rain against the glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a peach of a night!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid, as he
turned back with a shiver to his comfortable nook
on the old sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we&rsquo;re snug and cozy here,&rdquo; murmured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Phil. &ldquo;This is one of the best rooms in the
college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we only had our old chair,&rdquo; remarked Sid,
rather sadly. He seemed to miss it more than
the others, for it was his favorite place for study.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it won&rsquo;t come back to-night, at any
rate,&rdquo; observed Tom. &ldquo;Whew! Hear that
wind!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came a sudden burst of fury on the part
of the storm, that seemed to rock the very college.
In the midst of its rage, borne on the wings of
the wind and darkness, there came to the ears of
the three lads a mighty crash.</p>

<p>It seemed to vibrate through the air, and then
the echoes of it were swallowed up in the louder
roar of the wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; whispered Tom, in an awesome
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some building collapsed!&rdquo; gasped Phil.
&ldquo;Come on, fellows, we must see what it was!&rdquo;
and he reached for his raincoat, the others following
his example.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>WITH HAMMER AND SAW</small></h2>


<p>Out into the storm they raced, to find that the
alarm of the crash had been general, and that
students from all the dormitories, and also a
number of members of the faculty, were hurrying
from their rooms to learn what was the
trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it another fire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard it was the gymnasium that had blown
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody told me that Prexy&rsquo;s house was
destroyed by a bomb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Questions and statements like those were heard
on all sides, as the lads gathered in a group outside
the college, or stood in the pelting rain on
the campus.</p>

<p>The wind still blew with great violence, and
the downpour was in keeping with it. Anxious
eyes looked up to the sky to detect the shimmering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of flames, and were relieved when no glare met
their gaze, though in that rain it would have been
a big fire indeed that could have kept on burning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The noise was over that way,&rdquo; declared Tom
Parsons, pointing toward the gymnasium.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it was over there,&rdquo; and Phil indicated the
river. &ldquo;Maybe it was one of the boathouses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it was out on the athletic field,&rdquo; asserted
Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go have a look,&rdquo; proposed Holly Cross.
&ldquo;It was a great old crash, whatever it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it woke me up,&rdquo; said Bert Bascome. &ldquo;I
was dozing over my Latin prose, and I dreamed
we were playing Boxer Hall. I was making a
touchdown, and smashed into a goal-post&mdash;that
woke me up&mdash;or, rather, the racket did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, make a real touchdown when we play
Boxer, and we&rsquo;ll forgive you,&rdquo; put in Kindlings,
joining the group of football players. &ldquo;Come on,
let&rsquo;s investigate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the students reached the gridiron they saw,
even in the darkness, the cause of the crash. One
of the largest grandstands had collapsed. The
supports, weakened by the rain, had been unable
to stand against the force of the wind, and had
tilted over, letting the whole structure come slantingly
to the ground, like some cardboard house
upon which a heavy weight has fallen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For cat&rsquo;s sake, look at that!&rdquo; cried Phil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a ruin!&rdquo; added Sid, in despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The biggest grandstand, too!&rdquo; remarked
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows!&rdquo; cried Holly Cross.
&ldquo;Maybe we can prop it up so it won&rsquo;t go down
any farther,&rdquo; for part of the structure was still
standing.</p>

<p>Holly started toward it, but had not advanced
more than a few feet, when there came another
sudden burst of fury on the part of the wind, and
there was a second crash in the splintered and
broken timbers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come back!&rdquo; yelled Dan Woodhouse. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
be hurt! It&rsquo;s going to fall apart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an instinctive retreat on the part
of the throng of students, but the stand, after settling
forward a little more, became stationary,
and, aside from the flapping of a few loose
boards, the wind seemed incapable of doing any
more havoc.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, wouldn&rsquo;t that jar you!&rdquo; exclaimed
Dutch, as he carefully held Holly&rsquo;s umbrella over
his own head. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to hustle to have that
raised again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the game with Canton Military
Academy comes off soon,&rdquo; added Phil. &ldquo;The carpenters
will have to get busy in the morning.
Where&rsquo;s Kindlings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Say Dan, we&rsquo;ll have to have a meeting of the
athletic committee right away, and take some action
on this. If we can&rsquo;t use that grandstand for
the Canton game, we&rsquo;ll lose a lot of money, and,
goodness knows, we need the coin this year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; came in a chorus from the
others. Mr. Lighton, the coach, came up just
then, and agreed that immediate action was necessary,
late as it was.</p>

<p>The students were walking about the ruined
stand, oblivious to the pelting rain, and they might
have stayed there a long time, had not Mr. Zane
bustled up to inspect the wreck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, then, young gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you
had better all get back to your rooms. There is
nothing more to see, and there might be some
danger. The wind is increasing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope no more stands blow down,&rdquo; murmured
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Zane, we want to have a meeting of the
athletic committee, to take measures for rebuilding
the stand,&rdquo; spoke the football captain. &ldquo;May
we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to make a report of this to
Dr. Churchill, and you may come, if you like.
Also Mr. Lighton, and two or three members of
the committee.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Phil and Tom,&rdquo; urged Dan, and
the end and quarter-back followed. The other
boys, finding the storm most unpleasant, now that
the excitement was over, moved toward their
rooms.</p>

<p>Proctor Zane stated the case to the president,
and then Kindlings made his appeal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to arrange for the rebuilding of the
stand at once,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as we expect a big crowd
at the Canton game, and we need all the seats we
can get.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; remarked Dr. Churchill, musingly. &ldquo;I
presume the athletic committee has the funds
available to pay for the work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t, Dr. Churchill,&rdquo; answered
Holly Cross, who acted as treasurer, &ldquo;but we
thought the amount could be advanced from the
college treasury, and we could pay it back, as we
did once or twice before. We&rsquo;ll need quite a large
sum, I&rsquo;m afraid, for the stand is one of the big
ones, and is flat on the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; again mused the president. &ldquo;Well,
young gentlemen, I would be very glad indeed to
advance the money from our treasury, but, I regret
to say, that it is impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; repeated Holly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, for the reason that there is no money in
the treasury.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No money!&rdquo; The students looked at each
other aghast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; went on Dr. Churchill. &ldquo;This legal
complication regarding the missing quit-claim
deed, and the lawsuit that has been started against
the college, has made it necessary to spend considerable
cash in the way of preliminary fees and
court expenses. This has left the college without
a running balance. In fact, Randall is poorer
to-day than ever before. I might add that even
money to pay the salaries of the faculty is lacking,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was something like a gleam of hope in
the eyes of the youths, but it died away when the
president, with a grim smile added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will state, however, that the gentlemen of
the faculty regard the financial difficulty as only
temporary, and are willing to continue on without
pay for a while, so you see there is no excuse for
not attending lectures,&rdquo; and the president&rsquo;s eyes
twinkled. &ldquo;But that is why,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I can
not advance any sum for the rebuilding of the collapsed
grandstand. I am very sorry, but it will
have to stay down for the present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll lose on the Canton game,&rdquo; spoke
Sid in a low voice, &ldquo;lose money, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad we can&rsquo;t have it put up,&rdquo; came
from Phil, as the lads filed from the president&rsquo;s
room, where the conference had taken place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
&ldquo;No use in having a meeting, if we can&rsquo;t get the
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is too!&rdquo; cried Tom Parsons, suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think we fellows can raise enough cash
by ourselves?&rdquo; demanded Kindlings. &ldquo;I wish we
could, but we can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can raise enough for what I am going to
suggest,&rdquo; declared Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough for hammers and saws and nails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And let the grandstand rebuild itself?&rdquo; asked
Phil, incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Tom, eagerly. &ldquo;We fellows can
rebuild it ourselves! I know how to handle tools,
and I guess lots of the other fellows do, also. We
can do it if we try. We haven&rsquo;t got the money to
hire carpenters, so we&rsquo;ll be carpenters ourselves!
We&rsquo;ll build that grandstand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Carpenter Tom!&rdquo; cried Dutch
Housenlager, doing a Highland fling down the
long dormitory corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the difference between a beam
and a joist, and a two-by-four is as illuminating
to me as a Greek root would be to a baby,&rdquo; said
Kindlings, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m with you, fellows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I!&rdquo; cried Frank Simpson. &ldquo;I worked
in a lumber camp once, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, is there anything you didn&rsquo;t do?&rdquo; asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Holly, as he thought of the hazing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all
right, Simpson. You can carry the two-by-fours
for Kindlings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make him carry the beams and joists,&rdquo; suggested
Phil. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do for that, all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eagerly talking of the new idea, the boys gathered
in the room of our heroes, and such a lively
meeting was in progress that Proctor Zane was
forced to call an adjournment, though he was very
decent about it, and, hearing of the plan announced
that he would amend some of the college
rules, to enable the amateur carpenters to work
at night, by means of powerful arc lights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried the lads, and Proctor Zane
was cheered for one of the few times in his life.
He seemed to like it, too.</p>

<p>A meeting of the athletic committee was called
for early the next day, and the plan of having the
lads do the carpenter work was discussed in all
its details. There was some money available for
tools, and it developed that, as Tom had said,
many of the students were handy with them, some
even having done carpenter work in their vacations
to earn tuition money.</p>

<p>One of the janitors had once been a builder,
and he offered to show the boys how to do the
work properly, so that it would be safe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be almost as good as football practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
for us,&rdquo; declared Tom, when he and his chums
went to town to buy the tools and nails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will keep us on the jump, if we get it done
in time for the Canton game,&rdquo; declared Phil.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>SUSPICIONS</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Has anyone seen my hammer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where the mischief did I put those nails?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Tom, give us a hand setting this joist,
will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Phil, should this two-by-four go in with
the big side out, or the narrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simpson, look out, or you&rsquo;ll saw my finger.
You&rsquo;re too close to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! Ouch!&rdquo; and Holly Cross dropped the
hatchet he was using in place of a hammer, and
held his thumb in his mouth. &ldquo;Jerusalem crickets!&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never be able to practice football
if I keep on this way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a riot of sounds: hammering, planing,
and chiseling, and sawing; and, mingled with
them, the clatter of the lads&rsquo; voices, in entreaties,
commands, appeals for help, asking for advice,
or, as Holly&rsquo;s was, raised in agony over some misdirected
blow.</p>

<p>Work on rebuilding the grandstand was in full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
swing. On examination of the wrecked structure
after the storm, it was found that nearly all the
material in it could be used over again. All the
new lumber that would be needed would be some
heavy joists, to take the place of those broken in
the collapse.</p>

<p>They were quite expensive to buy, but a lumber
dealer who heard of the boys&rsquo; plight agreed to
let them have the timber, and to wait as long as
they liked for his pay. He even furnished a
couple of men to raise the heavy pieces into place,
and the boys voted him a first-class &ldquo;sport,&rdquo; and
sent him a season complimentary ticket to all the
games.</p>

<p>It was not as easy as it sounds, nor as simple
as the boys had expected, to rebuild the structure,
but they went at it with hearty good will, and a determination,
in the path of which nothing could
stand. The several janitors gave them all the
aid they could, but the boys did most of the work,
after they were told just how to do it.</p>

<p>Frank Simpson was of great help, for he was
probably the strongest and biggest lad in college,
and the way he could shoulder a beam, and walk
off with it to where it was needed in the work
was something to look at and admire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you fellows needn&rsquo;t stop work to watch
Frank,&rdquo; said Tom Parsons, who, because of his
knowledge of carpentry, and because he had proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the scheme, was, by common consent, made
a sort of foreman. &ldquo;Get busy, and do some of
the lifting yourselves,&rdquo; he advised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Tom,&rdquo; demanded Sid, &ldquo;what makes
these boards split every time I try to nail them
on these four-by-fours? I must be a hoodoo, for
I&rsquo;ve split half a dozen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those aren&rsquo;t four-by-fours,&rdquo; declared Tom.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re two-by-fours, or scantling, and there are
a lot of reasons why you split the boards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me one, and I&rsquo;ll be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re using cut nails, and you ought to
use wire ones there, as the boards are old and dry.
Then you have to nail so close to the edge that
they split easier than they would if you could put
the nails nearer the middle. But use wire nails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean those round ones?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. The cut nails are those black, square-headed
ones, and when you do use them, drive
&rsquo;em with the widest part of the end at right angles
to the grain of the wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, a lesson in geometry, young gentlemen?&rdquo;
asked a voice, and the students turned
quickly, to observe President Churchill observing
them with an amused smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; answered Sid. &ldquo;Tom was telling me
how to drive nails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, a very useful accomplishment, I believe,&rdquo;
remarked the doctor. &ldquo;Though I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
could do it without hitting my thumb. A very useful
accomplishment, very.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at the grandstand, which was nearing
completion, and, as he passed on, with a book
of Sanskrit under his arm, he remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are doing very well, young gentlemen&mdash;very
well. Randall has reason to be proud of her
resourceful students.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prexy looks worried,&rdquo; remarked Sid, as the
good doctor passed on out of hearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder but what that legal
business is bothering him,&rdquo; admitted Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a blamed shame it had to happen, but it&rsquo;s just like
the Langridge breed to want to stir up trouble.
Now, Sid, put plenty of nails in when you fasten
two scantling together, and use the big cut ones.
We don&rsquo;t want this stand to come down with a
lot of pretty girls on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; and Sid plied his hammer
with renewed energy, as though to prevent any
such catastrophe.</p>

<p>Tom went on with what he was doing, on another
part of the stand, until he was called by
Frank Simpson, who wanted his opinion on a certain
point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think if we run these cross-pieces the other
way,&rdquo; suggested the big Californian, &ldquo;it will brace
the stand better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; agreed Tom, after an examination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
&ldquo;Go ahead, do it that way, Frank. Want any
help getting that beam up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I can do it alone.&rdquo; Which the strong lad
did, to Tom&rsquo;s admiration.</p>

<p>And thus the building work went on. True, not
every joint was as even as regular carpenters
would have made them, and a number of boards
were sawed very crookedly, but this did not interfere
with the strength of the stand, and little was
cared for looks in the emergency.</p>

<p>President Churchill was not taking any chances,
however, and he privately sent for an architect
friend of his, who examined the rebuilt structure,
and assured the worried doctor that it was perfectly
safe.</p>

<p>Record time was made with the task, for three
hundred willing lads can accomplish wonders,
even if they lack the training of a trade. As the
date for the Canton game approached, it was seen
that the stand would be very nearly finished on
time. It was necessary to stop work sometimes to
get in football practice, but the boys were developing
unused muscles, and hardening others by
their labors, so that they were in fine physical
trim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best thing that could have happened,&rdquo;
said Holly Cross to Captain Woodhouse, at the
close of work one afternoon. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wipe the
ground up with Canton.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we ought to,&rdquo; declared Dan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so sure,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Lighton;
&ldquo;they have a pretty good team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ours is improving,&rdquo; asserted Kindlings,
proudly, and, in a measure, this was so, though
there were still some weak places in the line.</p>

<p>It was within two days of the Canton game,
and the boys were working eagerly to get the
stand in shape. They had put in several nights on
it, laboring in shifts, by the light of some flaming
arc lamps rigged up by the college electrician.</p>

<p>Tom, in virtue of his position as foreman, was
going about and doing as much as he could, when,
as he passed near Phil, who was nailing down
some of the seats, the quarter-back called to his
chum:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Tom, when you have a chance just take
a stroll over where that Lenton chap is working.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean Henry Lenton&mdash;the freshman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the chap who flocks by himself so much,
and always seems to be tinkering with something
in his room. See what he&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why; is he doing it wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but you remember the queer key we found
in our door that night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, just think of that when you see what
Lenton is doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wondering what motive Phil could have, Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
did stroll over to where, down in the front part
of the stand, the odd student was screwing some
hinges on the doors of a row of boxes, the seats
in which sold for higher prices than the ordinary
ones. Lenton was a strange lad. He was bright
in his studies, and his taste ran to matters scientific.
He was eager in the physics and chemistry
classes, and had made a number of ingenious machines
and pieces of apparatus to illustrate the
forces of nature.</p>

<p>As Tom approached he heard the shrill scraping
of a file, and at once what Phil had said about
the key came into his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what Lenton is filing?&rdquo; thought the
end. Not wishing to seem to sneak up on him, yet
desiring to solve the mystery, if there was one,
Tom called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Don&rsquo;t those hinges fit,
Lenton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of them do, and others don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;Or, rather, the hinges are all right, but
the hasps that hold the doors shut aren&rsquo;t true. I
have to file some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Tom, and then he noticed that the
lad had rigged up a small, portable iron vise on
the rail near which he was working. The vise
held a piece of metal, and this the lad was industriously
filing.</p>

<p>As Tom noticed the manner in which Lenton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
handled the tools, working with files of several
different sizes, the same suspicions that Phil had
entertained came into his own mind. As for the
files, Tom knew that none had been bought for
use on the stand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get &rsquo;em?&rdquo; he asked, picking up
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re mine,&rdquo; answered Lenton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got quite a few tools in my room,&rdquo; and then he
drew the file back and forth over the metal, making
such a noise that conversation was difficult.
Tom watched him a few minutes, and then turned
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phil was right,&rdquo; the end murmured. &ldquo;There
is something expert in the way he uses a file, and
perhaps he did make the false key. We&rsquo;ll have
to do some investigating.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>THE CLOCK COMES BACK</small></h2>


<p>They worked on the grandstand even during
the morning of the day when the Canton Military
game was to be played, and then the tired but
satisfied students laid aside their hammers and
saws, picked up the scattered nails, and sighed
with relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a big job&mdash;bigger than I thought it was
when I proposed it,&rdquo; spoke Tom, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m glad
it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; added Holly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take in some
money, now. I hear there&rsquo;s a big crowd coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We may have to take some of our funds for
the relief of the college, if things keep on,&rdquo; remarked
Kindlings. &ldquo;There was another meeting
of the faculty this morning, about that law and
claim business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; asked Phil. &ldquo;Cæsar&rsquo;s ghost! but
things aren&rsquo;t doing a thing but happening to Randall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s always darkest just before daylight,&rdquo;
observed Sid, and then the coach came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
along, and ordered them all out to light practice,
in preparation for the game soon to be played.</p>

<p>Tom and his two chums were on their way from
the gymnasium, refreshed by a shower bath, and
were going to their room, to rest a bit before appearing
on the gridiron with their team mates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you find out anything more about Lenton,
Tom?&rdquo; asked Phil, for it had been agreed that
Tom was to do a little detective work concerning
the queer lad and his files.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, nothing of any account,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;I talked with some of the fellows who room
next to him, and all they could tell me was that he
is always tinkering on something or other. He&rsquo;s
making some kind of an electrical machine, Perkins
said, and he keeps buzzing away at it half
the night. He&rsquo;s a queer Dick, all right, but I
don&rsquo;t know that he had anything to do with the
taking of our clock and chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my suspicions,&rdquo; declared Phil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
mighty sure he made that false key to our room,
anyhow, and I&rsquo;m going to put it up to him some
time soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; advised Sid. &ldquo;It might make
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, didn&rsquo;t he&mdash;or someone&mdash;make trouble
for us?&rdquo; asserted the quarter-back. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll be
pretty sure of my ground before I make any
cracks. Now for a rest, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A good fight!&rdquo; finished Tom, stretching out
his arms. &ldquo;I hope we wallop &rsquo;em good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As both Captain Woodhouse and Mr. Lighton
were sure of the ability of Randall to beat the military
eleven, a number of the substitute players
were allowed to go on the &rsquo;varsity team, much to
their delight, for they were hungry for a scrimmage.</p>

<p>There was a record-breaking crowd, and the
rebuilt grandstand was taxed to its capacity.
Though the Canton game was one of the minor
contests, it always drew well, and was quite a
society function, for the school was an exclusive
one. The cadets, in their natty uniforms, came
almost in a body, and of course the girls were
there in &ldquo;beautiful bunches,&rdquo; as Holly Cross said.
Not only damsels from the military school town,
but from Fairview and from Haddonfield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you what it is,&rdquo; said Holly, as he was
practicing with his mates; &ldquo;&lsquo;uniforms git gals,&rsquo;
as the schoolboy once wrote in his composition.
&lsquo;If you can&rsquo;t be a soldier, be a policeman, for
uniforms git girls.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got &rsquo;em here to-day, all right,&rdquo; observed
Sid. &ldquo;I hope that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the heads of our particular girls aren&rsquo;t
turned by any of the cadets,&rdquo; finished Phil, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>The game was on, and it was seen that, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Randall had every chance of beating, she would
have no easy contest for the victory. The cadets
played with a beautiful precision, and their team
work was something that made Coach Lighton
sigh in vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I get our fellows to play like that?&rdquo;
he asked in despair of Captain Woodhouse, during
a lull in the game, when one of the cadets had
the wind knocked out of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because of the changes so late in the season,&rdquo;
declared Kindlings. &ldquo;We miss Kerr and
Bricktop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, go on in and do &rsquo;em up,&rdquo; advised the
coach, as the referee&rsquo;s whistle blew. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let
&rsquo;em score on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if I know it,&rdquo; answered the captain.</p>

<p>The game was resumed fiercely. Knowing they
had little chance to win the game, the cadets devoted
all their energies to trying to score. They
wanted at least one touchdown, or a field goal,
and Randall was determined they should have
neither.</p>

<p>In the first ten minutes of play, Randall had
shoved the ball over the line, and the goal was
kicked. Then, after some rushing tactics, which
demonstrated that the cadets&rsquo; line was stronger
than at first appeared, Phil gave the signals for
some kicking plays. But it was soon demonstrated
that Canton was almost as good at this as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
was her rival, and while it was desired to get
some practicing in punting and drop work, it was
deemed too dangerous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Straight football,&rdquo; ordered the captain to the
quarter-back, and the game went on in that style.</p>

<p>There were several forward passes, that netted
good gains, and the onside kick was tried, until a
fumble nearly resulted in Canton scoring, and
then it was not used again.</p>

<p>Up the field the Randallites rushed the ball, not
so fast nor so easily but what they felt the strain,
and soon there was another touchdown against
the cadets. There was almost another in the first
half, but the whistle cut the play short, and the
nearest the military lads had been to scoring was
when they tried for a field goal, and failed, because
Sid broke through and blocked the kick.</p>

<p>With indomitable energy, the cadets went at
their opponents again in the second half. Several
fresh players were put in, and Captain Woodhouse
allowed other substitutes to try their
abilities.</p>

<p>This nearly proved the scratching down of a
score against Randall, as the new lads did not
hold well in line, and they were being shoved back
for a loss, when Phil called for some kicking tactics.
This took the ball out of danger, and soon
our friends had again crossed the military goal
line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>It was characteristic of the pluck of the Canton
lads that they never gave up. At it again they
went, hammer and tongs, giving their heavier rivals
no rest. It was a much more &ldquo;scrappy&rdquo; game
from the point of playing, than had been expected,
and on occasions excitement ran high. Several
times Randall was penalized for holding in the
line, or for off-side play, but this was due to the
eagerness of the substitutes, who had not the seasoned
judgment of the &rsquo;varsity men.</p>

<p>The game was drawing to a close, amid a riot
of songs and cheers. Randall had rolled up a big
enough score to satisfy even the exacting coach,
and there were but a few more minutes left to
play. Canton had the ball, it being given to her
on a penalty, and they were just over the centre
line, in the Randall territory. There came a
signal, and the Canton left half-back was sent
charging into the line between Sam Looper and
Bert Bascome.</p>

<p>Whose fault it was no one stopped to figure out,
but there was a big hole opened, Sam was sent
sprawling to one side, with Bascome on top of
him, and the man with the ball was through the
line, running like a deer for the Randall goal
line.</p>

<p>Sid Henderson tried for a tackle, and missed,
and then George Carter, who was playing full,
got ready to throw the man with the ball. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
latter proved to be a player of exceptional ability,
and speeding straight at the full-back, he suddenly
dodged, so that Carter, who made a dive for
him, also missed, and went sprawling.</p>

<p>There was now not a player between the Canton
man and the goal line. Like mad, his friends
leaped to their feet, and sent cheer after cheer
ringing into the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown!&rdquo;
was the frenzied yell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After him!&rdquo; shouted Captain Woodhouse.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him touch it down, fellows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was running desperately, but speed was not
his strong point. Tom Parsons, however, was on
the alert. There was not many who could beat
him at the scudding game, and he tore off over the
white marks after the cadet, with a fierce desire
to pull him down in his tracks. It was a hard
race, but Tom won, and grappled his man in a
fierce tackle from behind, not two yards from the
goal line. Down they went heavily, lying there
for a few seconds, the breath knocked from them
both.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do&mdash;down!&rdquo; gasped the cadet, and there were
tears in his eyes, for it meant the end of the hope
of his school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too bad, old man,&rdquo; spoke Tom kindly, &ldquo;but
we really couldn&rsquo;t allow it, you know. It was a
good try, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>The other did not answer. He still had the
ball, and there was another line-up, but before the
play could be made, the whistle blew, and Randall&rsquo;s
goal line was still inviolate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d he get through?&rdquo; demanded Captain
Woodhouse, when the cheering was over, and the
players were going to the dressing rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He got through between Bascome and me,&rdquo;
said the unlucky Snail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t my fault,&rdquo; declared the tackle. &ldquo;He
just pushed Sam over. It wasn&rsquo;t my fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it was <i>somebody&rsquo;s</i> fault,&rdquo; grumbled the
captain, &ldquo;and if it happens again, something else
will happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was quite a jolly time after the game, in
spite of the defeat of the military lads, and the
left half-back, who had made the sensational run,
and who had so nearly scored, was properly lionized.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When are you going to have another little
dance, girls?&rdquo; asked Tom, of Ruth Clinton and
her two friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you boys have another fire at Randall,&rdquo;
was the quick answer.</p>

<p>The little party of students had some refreshments
together, and then, as a little shower came
up, the crowd scurried for shelter, the girls going
back to Fairview.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it was a pretty good game, all right,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
remarked Tom, as he and his chums were walking
down the corridor to their room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty fair,&rdquo; admitted Phil. &ldquo;Hold on a minute,
fellows; I want to see something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there are any more keys in the door,&rdquo; answered
the quarter-back, &ldquo;and also whether anyone
is in there. Listen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They approached their portal cautiously, and
waited in silence for a moment, but heard no
sound. Then they entered, finding no false key in
the lock.</p>

<p>But, no sooner were the chums in their apartment,
than they were made aware of something
strange. As if by common impulse, they came to
a stop in the middle of the floor. Then Tom
cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen! Our old clock! The alarm clock!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A loud ticking was heard&mdash;a tick different from
that of the mahogany timepiece. Tom switched
on the light.</p>

<p>There, on the mantle, in the place where it had
always rested, was their battered old relic! They
gazed at it, scarcely able to believe their eyes.
Then Sid remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The clock has come back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And only increases the mystery,&rdquo; added Tom,
slowly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>SEEKING EVIDENCE</small></h2>


<p>Phil Clinton walked over to the mantle, and,
almost reverently, took down the fussy, ticking
clock. It seemed to make more noise than usual,
but perhaps this was because the room was so
quiet, or perchance they had become used to the
rather gentle tick-tock of the mahogany timepiece.
The quarter-back turned the clock over and over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s ours, all right,&rdquo; he finally announced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you have any doubt of it?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some,&rdquo; admitted Phil. &ldquo;There have been so
many queer things happening, that I don&rsquo;t know
whether or not to believe that we are really here,
that we exist, and that there is such a place as
Randall College.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be, if Langridge&rsquo;s father and
those other lawyers have their way,&rdquo; declared Sid,
solemnly.</p>

<p>Phil was still closely examining the clock, turning
it over and over, and listening to the tick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Tom. &ldquo;Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
you think it&rsquo;s got the measles or the pip, that you
have to hark to its breathing apparatus that
way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong with it,&rdquo; declared
Phil, with a dubious shake of his head. &ldquo;It
doesn&rsquo;t tick as it used to. Here, Sid, you listen to
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, Sid put the timepiece to his
ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember,&rdquo; went on Phil, &ldquo;how it
used to sort of have a double tick, like an automobile
with carbon in the cylinders? Sometimes
it would act as if it was going to stop, and you&rsquo;d
think it had heart failure. Then it would get on
the move again. It doesn&rsquo;t do that now. It ticks
as regular as a chronometer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; agreed Sid. &ldquo;Here, Tom,
have a hearken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a few minutes&rsquo; test, Tom was also forced
to conclude that there was something strange
about the clock. Yet it was undeniably theirs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s exactly right, too,&rdquo; went on Phil, comparing
it with his new watch, a present from his
mother. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s right to the half minute, and that&rsquo;s
something that never happened before since the
time when the memory of man runneth not to the
contrary. Whoever had it, and brought it back,
took the trouble to set it right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom was now carefully looking the clock over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
He gazed thoughtfully at the back, where there
were a number of turn screws and keys for winding
and setting it, and uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;our clock has been taken
apart and put together again. See, the back is
scratched where some one has used a knife or
screwdriver on it, and smell the oil they&rsquo;ve put on
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held it first to the nose of Sid, and then to
Phil. After several detecting whiffs, they both
gave it as their opinion that the clock had been
given an oil bath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This gets me!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil. &ldquo;Why in the
name of the seven sacred somnambulistic salamanders,
anyone should go to the trouble of making
a false key to our room, take our clock away,
renovate it, and then bring it back I can&rsquo;t see for
the life of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; came from Sid, as he slumped
down on the sofa. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got it back, anyhow,
and isn&rsquo;t there a proverb to the effect that
you shouldn&rsquo;t look a beggar in the mouth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking of gift-horses,&rdquo; declared
Tom, &ldquo;but what you mean is, &lsquo;take the gifts the
gods provide.&rsquo; Still, it is mighty queer, and I
wish we could get some clews that would help
unravel the mystery&mdash;that of our chair as well as
the clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid uncurled long enough to reach out and get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
a book, which he began to study, while Phil set
himself at some of his college tasks. Only Tom
remained inactive&mdash;yet not inactive, either, for
he was doing some hard thinking, in which the
clock, the missing chair, and the troubles of Randall
in general, formed a part. He arose and
walked about the room, pausing now and then in
front of the clock to listen to the insistent ticking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, for cat&rsquo;s sake, sit down!&rdquo; exploded Phil,
at length. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve written this same sentence over
six times, and I can&rsquo;t get it right yet, with you
tramping around like a prisoner in a cell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, go to bed,&rdquo; urged Sid.</p>

<p>Tom did not answer. Instead, he stooped over
and picked up an envelope from the floor, where
it had fallen partly under and was almost hidden
by a low bookcase. He turned it over to read the
address, and uttered a startled cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; demanded Sid, springing
to an upright position with such suddenness,
that the old sofa creaked and groaned in protest,
like a ship in a storm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom. &ldquo;This letter&mdash;I
found it on the floor&mdash;it&rsquo;s addressed to Bert Bascome&mdash;from
someone in the college, evidently, for
it hasn&rsquo;t been through the mail, as there&rsquo;s no
stamp on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid and Phil eagerly examined the missive, turning
it over and over, as if something on it might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
escape them. It was a plain white envelope, and
was sealed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That throws some light on the mystery, and
bears out my suspicion,&rdquo; went on Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What light?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what suspicion?&rdquo; demanded Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The suspicion that Langridge has had a hand
in this mystery, and that Bert Bascome has been
in our room since we last left it. That letter
wasn&rsquo;t here when we went out, I&rsquo;m sure of that,
so Bascome must have dropped it when he
brought back the clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brought back the clock!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;Do
you mean to say he took it&mdash;and the chair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I do, but either he or Langridge
had a hand in it,&rdquo; asserted Tom, positively.
&ldquo;Langridge probably put Bascome up to it, to
annoy us. You know Bascome and that bully
were quite thick with each other before Langridge
was forced to leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this letter isn&rsquo;t in the handwriting of
Langridge, Tom,&rdquo; objected Sid. &ldquo;I know <i>his</i> fist
well enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Phil. &ldquo;But I can tell
you who did write this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded Tom and Sid, in a breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henry Lenton,&rdquo; was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, the fellow you suspected of making
the false key?&rdquo; cried Tom, in startled tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the chap. He wrote this letter to Bascome;
I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then those two are in the game against us!&rdquo;
came from Sid. &ldquo;Oh, say, this is getting more
puzzling than ever! What can we do about it&mdash;Langridge&mdash;Bascome&mdash;Lenton&mdash;who&rsquo;s
guilty&mdash;who
had our clock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find out one thing!&rdquo; declared
Tom, with energy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Phil, as his chum arose
and strode toward the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give Bascome this letter, and find
out what he was doing in our room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may make trouble,&rdquo; warned Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if I do! I&rsquo;m going to get to the
bottom of this,&rdquo; and holding the envelope as if
it might somehow get away from him, Tom strode
from the apartment, his footsteps echoing down
the corridor, while back in the room his chums
listened to the ticking of the clock that formed a
link in the curious mystery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>BASCOME DENIES</small></h2>


<p>Tom Parsons knocked vigorously on the door
of Bert Bascome&rsquo;s room. If the character of his
summons was any indication of his mind, the
bearer of the letter was in no mood for compromise.
As soon as he had tapped at the portal,
there was audible within the apartment a hasty
scramble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess they must think it&rsquo;s Zane, or Prexy,&rdquo;
mused Tom, grimly. He waited several seconds,
and then came the gentle and somewhat sleep-simulated
query:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me&mdash;Parsons,&rdquo; was the ready, if ungrammatical,
answer. &ldquo;Are you there, Bascome?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. I thought it was one of the
profs. It&rsquo;s all right, fellows&mdash;you can come out,&rdquo;
and, as the door opened, Tom saw several of Bascome&rsquo;s
friends crawling from under the bed and
couch. There was a smell of cigarette smoke
quite noticeable in the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew! You fellows are going some!&rdquo; commented
Tom. &ldquo;You can smell that all the way up
to our room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! Can you really?&rdquo; asked Bascome, in
some alarm. &ldquo;We opened all the windows, and
we fan the smoke out regularly every ten minutes;
don&rsquo;t we, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied Merkle, one of the sportiest
of sporty seniors. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s regular bore to think we
have to sneak around this way when we want to
smoke. Why, in some big colleges, I understand,
they allow the undergraduates to smoke in their
rooms, and even the tutors have a pipe with
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pity this isn&rsquo;t a big college,&rdquo; remarked Bascome,
as he lighted another cigarette. &ldquo;I suppose
I oughtn&rsquo;t to do this when I&rsquo;m in training,&rdquo;
he went on easily, &ldquo;but you won&rsquo;t squeal, will you,
Parsons? Have a cig. yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you. May I see you just a moment,
Bascome?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom had not thought to find anyone in the
room save the left tackle, and he hardly knew
how, under the circumstances, to put his question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; answered Bascome. &ldquo;Anything about
football? Because if it is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Tom, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then, come on out. Excuse me just a moment,
fellows,&rdquo; he said to his guests, as he followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
our hero out into the corridor. &ldquo;I hope it
isn&rsquo;t spondulix, old man,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d let
you have some in a moment, but I&rsquo;m dead broke,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need any money!&rdquo; broke in Tom, half
angrily. &ldquo;Look here, Bascome, were you in our
room to-day&mdash;after the football game?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In your room? Certainly not, either before
the game or after it. What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; went on Tom, &ldquo;there have been some
queer things happening lately. Our old chair was
taken&mdash;for a joke, I presume, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to accuse me of having a hand
in that?&rdquo; demanded Bascome, indignantly. &ldquo;If
you do, Parsons&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it easy,&rdquo; advised Tom, calmly. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t accused you of anything yet. I merely
asked you if you had been in our room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why do you do that? What makes you
think I was in there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I found this there&mdash;after we came
back from the game this afternoon,&rdquo; went on the
end. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a letter addressed to you, and I
thought maybe you had dropped it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom held out the missive, but, before taking
it, Bascome, with a glance of anger at his companion,
said cuttingly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Parsons, I don&rsquo;t know what your
game is, but I think you&rsquo;re confoundedly insulting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Now, before I look at that letter, I want to say,
in the strongest way I know how, that I was <i>not</i>
in your room to-day, nor any other day lately.
In fact, I haven&rsquo;t been there since a lot of us fellows
were talking over football matters with you
and Phil and Sid one evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember that time,&rdquo; spoke Tom.
&ldquo;Well, I believe you, of course. Here&rsquo;s the letter.
It&rsquo;s mighty queer, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bascome gave one glance at the missive, and
murmured:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lenton! I wonder what he&rsquo;s writing about
now. That fellow&rsquo;s off his base, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he read the note, a scowl came over his face,
and he muttered something that Tom could not
catch. However, the end did hear Bascome say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Insolent puppy! He&rsquo;s got nerve to write to
me that way! I&rsquo;ll have it out with him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, with rapid motions, Bascome tore the letter
to pieces, and scattered them about the corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t throw any light on the mystery that
has been bothering you fellows, about your clock
and chair,&rdquo; went on the tackle. &ldquo;I had some dealings
with Lenton, and this was about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask to know what was in the letter,&rdquo;
said Tom, quickly. &ldquo;The only funny part of it
was that it was in our room. I thought perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
he hesitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t make any bones about it,&rdquo; urged his
fellow player. &ldquo;You might as well say it as think
it. You imagined I had been in there, playing
some sort of a joke on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; admitted Tom. &ldquo;Our clock was
returned mysteriously to-night, and the one left in
its place was taken away. The other night we
found a false key in our door, and now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you find a letter addressed to me!&rdquo; interrupted
Bascome. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you for thinking
it a bit queer, old man, but I&rsquo;m not in the game.
I&rsquo;ve got other fish to fry. The way I suppose my
letter got in you fellows&rsquo; room, is that Wallops, or
some of the messengers to whom Lenton gave it
to be delivered to me, must have dropped it
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Wallops nor none of the messengers
would have a right to go into our room while we
were out,&rdquo; declared Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t tell what those fellows would
do,&rdquo; asserted Bascome, easily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager that&rsquo;s
how it happened. Ask Wallops. I&rsquo;m out of it,
anyhow. I wasn&rsquo;t in your shack, and you can&rsquo;t
make that too strong when you report back to
Phil and Sid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; promised Tom, somewhat nonplused
at the outcome of the affair. He had been sure
that something would come of the connection between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Bascome and the letter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I took
you away from your friends,&rdquo; he went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;d rather have you <i>speak</i>
openly like this, than be <i>thinking</i> a lot of queer
things. No, I&rsquo;m out of it. The letter had nothing
to do with your clock or chair,&rdquo; and with this denial
Bascome turned back toward his own room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; he called to Tom; &ldquo;that is, unless
you&rsquo;ll join us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused and looked back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, I&rsquo;m going to turn in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom swung around, and was about to proceed
down the corridor, when the torn pieces of the letter
Bascome had destroyed caught his eye. By
this time the other youth had entered his room,
before Tom could call to him that perhaps he
had better pick up the scraps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, leave them there,&rdquo; mused Tom. &ldquo;I
guess if he doesn&rsquo;t care whether or not anyone
sees them, I oughtn&rsquo;t to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly he walked along, when a piece of paper,
rather larger than the other fragments, was
turned over by the draft of his walking. It was
directly under a hall light, and Tom could not
help seeing the words written on it. They stood
out in bold relief&mdash;three words&mdash;and they were
these:</p>

<p class="noic"><i>the alarm clock</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom stared at them as if fascinated. They
seemed to be written in letters of fire. He stooped
and picked up the piece of the torn letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The alarm clock!&rdquo; murmured Tom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
wager anything Lenton <i>was</i> writing about our
clock, and yet Bascome said the letter didn&rsquo;t have
a thing in it about our mystery. I wonder&mdash;I
wonder if he expects me to believe that&mdash;now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment he paused, half inclined to go
back and have it out with Bascome. Then he
realized that this would not be the wisest plan.
Besides, he wanted to talk with Phil and Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell them,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Maybe they can
see through it, for I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I can. &lsquo;The
alarm clock!&rsquo; I wonder if I would be justified in
picking up the rest of the pieces, and seeing what
I could make of them? No! Of course I couldn&rsquo;t
read another fellow&rsquo;s letter, even to solve the
mystery. It&rsquo;s not serious enough for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Tom, after another look at the scrap he
had, thrust it into his pocket, as much for the sake
of preventing it from falling into the hands of
curiosity seekers, as for any other reason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what Phil and Sid can make of it,&rdquo;
he mused, and then, hearing someone approaching,
Tom hastened on to his own room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly is queer,&rdquo; said Phil, when Tom
had told him the result of his little excursion. &ldquo;I
think I&rsquo;d almost have picked up the whole letter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Bascome couldn&rsquo;t have cared much about it, or he
wouldn&rsquo;t have thrown the pieces into the hall.
Guess I&rsquo;ll go get &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t do a thing like that,&rdquo; declared
Sid quickly. &ldquo;I know a better plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; inquired Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask Wallops if he had a note to deliver
to Bascome from Lenton. He may have gotten
in our room by mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; cried Tom, quickly. &ldquo;The very
thing. Maybe that will help clear it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was comparatively early, and Wallops was
found in the janitors&rsquo; quarters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, in answer to Sid&rsquo;s inquiry,
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen Mr. Bascome or Mr. Lenton this
evening, and I had no note for either of them, nor
from one. And I wasn&rsquo;t in your room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil, quickly, for
he did not want to create any talk. &ldquo;I dare say
it was a mistake. Come on, fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think now?&rdquo; asked Tom,
as the three were on their way to their room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think either Bascome or Lenton was in our
room,&rdquo; declared Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but which one?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>No one could answer him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>HALED TO COURT</small></h2>


<p>Our heroes were in a quandary. They had
gotten on the trail of the mystery, and it diverged
in two directions. Both paths seemed to lead to
one or the other of two students&mdash;Bascome or
Lenton. To accuse either, or to question them,
would mean serious trouble, for it would be considered
as an insult. Tom and his chums realized
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what gets me, if either one of them <i>did</i>
take our clock and chair, is what their motive
could have been,&rdquo; spoke Tom. &ldquo;Why in the mischief
should they take our battered old ticker,
leave another in its place, and then make the exchange
again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as easy to answer as to say who has
our chair,&rdquo; declared Phil. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t in Bascome&rsquo;s
room, that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Lenton hasn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; asserted Tom. &ldquo;I
found that out, all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the morning after the sensational discovery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of the letter, and they were still discussing
it, without apparently getting anywhere. They
had tacitly agreed that, without more evidence
than they now possessed, it would be folly to go
to Bascome again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here,&rdquo; proposed Tom, after
some more talk on the subject. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost
late for chapel as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is doubtful if either of the three chums gave
much consideration to the services that morning.
Their minds were too much filled with other
matters.</p>

<p>Dr. Churchill made an announcement to the
effect that there might soon be some news to communicate
in the matter of the suit against the
college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At present,&rdquo; he stated, &ldquo;the matter is in the
hands of the lawyers, and we hope to effect a
compromise. If we arrive at one, I shall be most
happy to let you young gentlemen know of it. Of
course, too, there is the possibility of unfavorable
news. But, in any event, I know that you will be
loyal to the college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; cried Bean Perkins, fervently, and
he was not rebuked, for the devotional exercises
were over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what Prexy meant by bad news?&rdquo;
asked Holly Cross, as he walked over the campus
with Tom and several other chums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t mean that we&rsquo;re going to lose the
game with Fairview Saturday, I hope,&rdquo; put in
Kindlings. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have long practice
this afternoon, and I want every fellow to show
up. Simpson, I&rsquo;m going to give you a chance at
left guard in the second half of the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; exclaimed the big Californian,
fervently.</p>

<p>The practice on the gridiron that afternoon was
the hardest to which the players had yet been
subjected. The scrub had been instructed to play
for all they were worth against the &rsquo;varsity, and
the inducement was held out that if any of the
second team outplayed the man against him on the
regular eleven, that he could replace him in the
Fairview game.</p>

<p>This was enough to stir the blood of the scrubs,
and they went at the &rsquo;varsity hammer and tongs.
The result was rather a surprise, for the regulars
developed unexpected strength in the line. And
even Snail Looper proved that he could do well
when he wanted to, for when the backs were sent
against him and Bascome, the two held well together,
and the wave of human beings, of whom
one had the ball, was dashed back, failing to gain
in several cases.</p>

<p>There was one particularly hot scrimmage, and
Andrews, who was playing left half-back on the
scrub, went at the line like a stone from a catapult.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
He broke through, and Pete Backus and
Sid Henderson, who tried to tackle him, missed.
Andrews was gathering his speed for a spring
down the field for a touchdown, when Phil Clinton,
who had circled out of the press, was after
him like a shot, and after a daring tackle threw
him heavily.</p>

<p>But, somehow or other, Phil slipped, and his
foot was doubled under him. When he got up he
limped painfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Lighton,
anxiously, as he ran up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twisted my ankle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it sprained?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, only a little. I&rsquo;ll be all right in a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had his shoe off in a jiffy, and massaged
the ankle, but it did little good, and wanting to
save his quarter-back for the big game on Saturday,
Captain Woodhouse sent in Art Benson, as a
substitute. Phil retired to the side lines, tears of
chagrin in his eyes, but his friends comforted him
with the thought that he would be all right by Saturday
if he rested, while, if he didn&rsquo;t he couldn&rsquo;t
play against Fairview.</p>

<p>The game went on, and, as if nerved by Phil&rsquo;s
injury, the &rsquo;varsity played like fiends. They
rushed the unfortunate scrub team all over the
field, and rolled up more touchdowns than they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
had previously done in practice that season.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll come out all right,&rdquo; spoke Kindlings,
gleefully, to the coach, as they walked from
the field, discussing some new plays that had been
tried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more hopeful,&rdquo; answered Mr. Lighton.</p>

<p>A hot bath, a rub down and a vigorous massaging
of his ankle with liniment, made Phil feel
much better, and that night, propped up in an easy
position on the sofa&mdash;the seat of honor&mdash;the
quarter-back received his friends, several of whom
dropped in to inquire after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be fit, old man?&rdquo; asked Holly Cross,
anxiously. &ldquo;I hear that Fairview has it in for us
for keeps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;ll be on hand,&rdquo; declared Phil, gamely.
&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; remarked Kindlings, with a dubious
shake of his head. &ldquo;We can tell better in the
morning.&rdquo; For he well knew that such injuries
as Phil&rsquo;s often became worse in a few hours than
they seemed at first.</p>

<p>The captain&rsquo;s apprehension was realized, for
the next morning Phil could not step on his foot,
and Dr. Marshall, the college physician, was
summoned.</p>

<p>The doctor looked at the swollen ankle, felt of
it gently, thereby causing Phil to wince with pain,
and then announced:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No playing for you, Clinton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to play, doctor. I&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to be
in the game against Fairview Saturday. That&rsquo;s
three days off. Won&rsquo;t it be well then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well enough to play if I wear a leather protector?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you play, you may be out of the game the
rest of the season,&rdquo; was the solemn answer. &ldquo;I
must forbid it. You may do yourself serious injury.
What you need is complete rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil gasped, and held back the exclamation that
sprang to his lips&mdash;an exclamation partly of bitterness
and partly of pain, for the physician was
rebandaging the foot. Then he turned his face
to the wall, and when the doctor was gone, Tom
and Sid sat in silent communion with their chum.
For they knew how he felt, and knew that mere
words could only make the wounded spirit more
sore. Silence was the best balm, and silence there
was, with only the fussy clock to mark the passage
of the seconds.</p>

<p>Phil&rsquo;s ankle was even worse the next day, and it
was announced that he would not be in the Fairview
game, which news cast a gloom over Randall,
and caused rejoicing in the camp of their
rivals, for Fairview was none too sure of a victory,
though they had a fine eleven. Benson, the
substitute quarter, was slated for the contest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>There was hard practice every available moment
up to the night before the game, and though
the team was rather demoralized, the captain and
coach, by vigorous words, kept the players up to
the mark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to win! We&rsquo;re going to win!&rdquo;
they said over and over again.</p>

<p>There was a noticeable air of something portending
when Dr. Churchill and his colleagues
took their seats on the platform at chapel the next
morning. The president&rsquo;s voice was solemn as
he read the Scriptures, more solemn as he offered
prayer, and when he advanced to the edge of the
rostrum to make an announcement, there was a
long breath of expectation from the students.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it about football or the trouble, I wonder?&rdquo;
whispered Holly Cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quiet,&rdquo; begged Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young gentlemen,&rdquo; began the president, &ldquo;I
regret to say that I have bad news for you. Randall
College has lost the first skirmish in the legal
battle. The directors have been summoned to
court to show cause why they should not vacate
the land whereon our buildings stand. The matter
had assumed a serious phase, all through the
loss of that quit-claim deed.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>DEFEAT</small></h2>


<p>There was a buzz of excitement; everyone was
whispering to his neighbor, and there was even
talking among the members of the faculty.</p>

<p>Dr. Churchill gave a few more facts concerning
the matter, stating that though the first move had
gone against the college, the Randall legal representatives
hoped to be successful in court.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might add,&rdquo; went on the good doctor, &ldquo;that
we are making every effort to locate the missing
quit-claim deed. And I might also add that if
any of you young gentlemen happen upon it, the
faculty and myself, as well as the directors, will
be under great obligations to you, if you will turn
it over to us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To that end, perhaps, I had better describe
the deed,&rdquo; which the president did, at the same
time making a few remarks concerning legal matters,
and impressing on the students the necessity
of taking care of legal papers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will now know the document, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
should happen to see it,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;though
I fear we cannot hope for that. But we will not
give up yet,&rdquo; he added, and then the exercises
came to an end.</p>

<p>Discussion on the new development of the
trouble continued, as the students filed out of
chapel, and strolled across the campus, some to
lectures, some to studies, while others, who had
the early periods free, made for the football
field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rotten shame, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; exclaimed Holly
Cross, as he dug his toe into the pigskin with
vicious force. &ldquo;I wish I had some of the lawyers
who are making the trouble where this ball is,&rdquo;
and as the spheroid again sailed high into the
air, Holly grinned in delight at his effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s just like Langridge to make trouble,&rdquo;
agreed Tom. &ldquo;Probably he&rsquo;s delighted at the
turn affairs have taken, and he very likely hopes
to see Randall down and out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; declared Frank, as he passed
the ball to Jerry Jackson. &ldquo;I feel sure we&rsquo;re
going to win. As sure as I feel that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put it all over Fairview,&rdquo; finished Billy
Housenlager. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to do &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad you feel that way,&rdquo; spoke Captain
Woodhouse. &ldquo;But with Phil laid up&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not finish, but they all knew what he
meant. Up to the last, there was hope that Phil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
might pull around in time to play at least part of
the game, but the doctor soon put an end to this
thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s utterly out of the question,&rdquo; he said, and
Phil, with a groan, turned his face to the wall.</p>

<p>As if Randall did not have trouble enough,
more developed the night before the game. There
had been a final meeting of the eleven, and Phil
had managed to limp to it on a crutch. Final instructions
were given by the coach, some new plays
were decided upon, and a particular code of signals,
of which there were several in use, was
adopted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No objections to taking a glass of ginger ale
before we turn in, is there, Mr. Lighton?&rdquo; asked
Jerry Jackson of the coach, who was a strict
trainer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll allow you one,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on then, fellows, I&rsquo;ll stand treat. Got
something extra in my allowance this month,&rdquo;
went on the Jersey twin, and he led a crowd of
his chums to a small refreshment place that did
a thriving business just outside the college
grounds.</p>

<p>Whether it was the ginger ale, or the excitement
caused by anticipating the game, was not
ascertained, but it was a fact that in the night Sid
Henderson was taken ill. Tom heard his chum
groaning, and, sitting up in bed, asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, old man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I feel as if I was burning up
inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom was at Sid&rsquo;s bed in a moment, and placed
the back of his hand on his friend&rsquo;s cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve got a fever!&rdquo; he exclaimed
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to call for Dr. Marshall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wallops was sent for the physician, who pronounced
Sid a very sick youth, and ordered his
removal to the sick ward, a sort of emergency
hospital maintained at Randall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised but what it was the
ginger ale,&rdquo; said the physician, after questioning
Sid. &ldquo;You have a very bad bilious attack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will I&mdash;will I be all right by morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By morning? Gracious, young man, what
do you think we doctors are, magicians? We
have to wait for Nature to help us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I can&rsquo;t play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play? I should say not! You&rsquo;ve got to stay
in bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, wouldn&rsquo;t that get your goat!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tom, when he heard the news. &ldquo;Phil and Sid
both out of the game. Now we <i>are</i> up against
it, for further orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil did not answer, but he gritted his teeth,
and in the darkness stepped out of bed, bearing
his weight on his injured ankle. He could hardly
keep back an exclamation of agony, as a sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
pain shot through him, and he knew that what he
had hoped for&mdash;that he might possibly play&mdash;was
out of the question.</p>

<p>The day dawned cold and fair, ideal weather
for football, with no wind to make kicking difficult.
The contest was to take place at Randall,
and the squad was out early at practice. It was
rather a serious gridiron squad, too, for the absence
of two of the best players crippled the team
in a manner that none cared to think about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jove, but I wish I was going to be with you!&rdquo;
spoke Sid softly, when Tom paid a visit to him,
just before the time for calling the game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you were,&rdquo; said the end. &ldquo;I guess
you&rsquo;d better pray for us, Sid, for we sure are up
against it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil managed to limp out on the side lines,
where he sat wrapped in a blanket like an Indian
brave, and watched the preliminary practice, unable
to keep back the tears that came into his eyes.</p>

<p>There was a big crowd present. Every stand
was filled, and there were throngs about the field.
George Carter was to play in Sid&rsquo;s place, and Art
Benson would be at quarter. The rest of the team
was made up substantially as the one that had
played the previous games, save that Frank Simpson
was slated to play one half at left guard,
dividing with Sam Looper.</p>

<p>It was the first big game of the season, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
both teams were on their mettle. In the stand
given over to the cohorts of Fairview there was
a big crowd, of which a goodly part were girls
from the co-educational institution. Their shrill
cheers, songs and cries mingled with the hoarser
shouts of the Fairview lads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Madge and the others are cheering
against us?&rdquo; asked Tom, as he passed the ball
to Simpson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you can hardly blame them for sticking
up for their own college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s so. Say, they&rsquo;re a lively eleven, all
right, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They sure are! Never mind, though, Parsons,
we&rsquo;ll go through &rsquo;em all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There had been many changes in the Fairview
eleven, but some of the lads who had played before
were on the team. There was Lem Sellig,
who played quarter, instead of in his old position
of left half-back, Frank Sullivan was at right end,
and Roger Barns was full-back; Ted Puder was
playing left guard.</p>

<p>The practice was over, the toss had been made,
and Randall was to kick off. Bean Perkins had
led his cheerers in many songs and college yells,
and the colors on his cane were frayed from much
waving.</p>

<p>The referee&rsquo;s whistle blew, and Kindlings, with
a final glance at his own men and those of Fairview,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
nodded to Holly Cross, who was to send
the ball down the field.</p>

<p>There was a thud as the toe of the big centre
met the pigskin, and away it sailed. It was caught
by Ed Turton, who was playing left half-back,
and he managed to get over about fifteen yards
before he was caught and heavily thrown by Tom
Parsons. Then came the line up, and the first
scrimmage.</p>

<p>At the line came Fred Hanson, the right half-back,
aided by his mates. Right for a space between
Bert Bascome and Snail Looper he headed,
and managed to get through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold &rsquo;em! Hold &rsquo;em!&rdquo; begged Kindlings,
desperately, but his men were shoved back, and
there was a two-yard gain. It was not much, but
it showed the power that was behind the Fairview
plays. There was a burst of triumphant
cheers from the co-educational supporters, and
silence on the part of the cohorts of Randall, as
they waited for the next play. It came promptly,
and netted three yards. Then a run around right
end tore off four yards more, and it looked as if
Fairview would rush the ball for a touchdown in
short order.</p>

<p>But, in answer to the frantic appeals from
Kindlings, his players braced desperately, and
held their opponents to such advantage that Fairview<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
was forced to kick, and Randall had the ball,
and a chance to show what she could do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, then, boys!&rdquo; cried Benson, as he began
to give the signal, &ldquo;tear &rsquo;em apart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a heart-meant appeal, but something was
lacking. Phil&rsquo;s magnetic presence was needed,
and though Pete Backus, to whom the ball was
passed, managed to wiggle through for a yard
gain, there was noticed a great strength in the line
of Fairview, against which the Randall players
hurled themselves. Another try only netted two
yards, and then, not wanting to give up the ball by
sending it sailing into the enemy&rsquo;s territory, Benson
signalled for a fake kick, Joe Jackson dropped
back, and Holly Cross snapped the ball to George
Carter, who was playing in Sid&rsquo;s place. <a href="#image04">Carter
at once passed it to Joe, who ran with it.</a> But,
alas for the hopes of Randall! Joe dropped the
pigskin, and Jake Johnson, the big centre of Fairview,
who had broken through, fell on it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">
<a id="image04" name="image04"><img src="images/image04.jpg" width="378" height="600" alt="CARTER AT ONCE PASSED IT TO JOE, WHO RAN WITH IT." title="CARTER AT ONCE PASSED IT TO JOE, WHO RAN WITH IT." /></a><br />
<span class="caption"><a href="#Page_195">CARTER AT ONCE PASSED IT TO JOE, WHO RAN WITH IT.</a></span>
</div>

<p>There was a wild riot of yells on the part of
the Fairview crowd, and groans of anguish from
Randall. The Fairview players quickly lined up,
and almost before Kindlings and his men had recovered
from their astonishment and chagrin,
Fred Hanson had broken through, and was speeding
for the goal line. He got past all the tacklers,
and after a sensational run, planted the ball between
the posts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Touchdown! Touchdown!&rdquo; came the fierce
cries. Randall realized that she had been scored
upon for the first time that season, and the fact
was bitter to her.</p>

<p>The goal was kicked, and there were six points
against our friends. It was disconcerting, but
they went back into the play with such fierce
energy that inside of the next ten minutes they had
forced their opponents up the field to their five-yard
line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, boys, give it to &rsquo;em! Don&rsquo;t wait until
you can see the whites of their eyes, but give it to
&rsquo;em!&rdquo; howled Bean Perkins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Touchdown! Touchdown!&rdquo; yelled the Randall
crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give &rsquo;em the good old song, fellows,&rdquo; fairly
screamed Bean. &ldquo;Conquer or Die,&rdquo; and he led
the singing of &ldquo;<i>Aut Vincere, Aut Mori</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was just the note needed to make the Randall
players turn themselves into football fiends,
and they ripped the Fairview line apart, and had
the ball over in another minute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, kick the goal, and tie the score!&rdquo; urged
Bean, but it was not to be. The ball hit the post,
and bounced back, and Fairview had still one point
the better.</p>

<p>There was hard playing the rest of the half,
but neither side scored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think about it?&rdquo; asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Kindlings, of the coach, during the rest period.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to say,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have to do better, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lose,&rdquo; spoke the captain, grimly.</p>

<p>The story of the second half of the game is
shameful history to Randall. It started off fairly
well, but there was fumbling, and even the presence
of the big Californian, who replaced the
Snail, could not avert the defeat that was in store.</p>

<p>Try as Randall did, she could not make the necessary
gains, and the players hurled themselves
against the stone wall defense of Fairview. On
the other hand, the Fairview players found several
holes in their opponents&rsquo; line, through which
they made substantial advances with the ball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold &rsquo;em! Hold &rsquo;em!&rdquo; begged Kindlings,
desperately, the fear of defeat staring him in the
face. His men worked like the ancient trojans,
and Tom Parsons covered himself with glory
twice; once when he made a sensational tackle,
and saved a touchdown that seemed imminent,
and again when he made a brilliant run of sixty
yards, and would have scored, but for an unfortunate
slip that enabled George Curtis, the Fairview
left end, to nab him.</p>

<p>That was as near as Randall came to scoring
in the second half, while Fairview made three
more touchdowns, though only one resulted in a
goal. The score stood twenty-two to five against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Randall when she was awarded the ball for interference
and offside play on the part of her eager
rival, who wanted to roll up a bigger total.
There was only a little time left to play, and
Kindlings desperately called upon his men in every
way he knew how to rally and score again.</p>

<p>There were desperate&mdash;aye, even tear-stained
faces&mdash;among the Randall players as they lined
up. Hearts were beating as though they would
burst. Lungs were panting, and tired muscles
fairly begged for relief. There came a great
heave as the big Californian tore a hole in the
Fairview line to let Pete Backus through, but
Pete was almost downed in his tracks, and ere the
line could be formed again, the whistle blew, and
the game was over.</p>

<p>For a moment the struggling players could
scarcely realize it, and then, as the truth broke
over the Randall lads, and they heard the shouting
of the great crowd&mdash;as they knew the score&mdash;twenty-two
to five&mdash;they filed silently from the
gridiron.</p>

<p>It is not writing of anything disgraceful against
old Randall when I say that more than one player
shed tears&mdash;bitter tears. And they were not assuaged
by the hearty cheer which Fairview gave
her rival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;boys, three&mdash;three cheers for Fairview!&rdquo;
called Kindlings brokenly, in return, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
his voice was not the only one that faltered when
the tiger was given.</p>

<p>Silently the Randall crowd left the grandstands,
while the victorious cohorts of Fairview were
singing their songs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys!&rdquo; cried Bean Perkins, eagerly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let
our fellows go off that way. Give &rsquo;em the &lsquo;Conquer
or Die&rsquo; song, but&mdash;sing it softly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, out over the big field, welled the
beautiful strains of the Latin hymn. The effect
was wonderful, for the boys were good singers.
The great crowd halted and listened, as the last
chords died softly away.</p>

<p>Then came a great cheer&mdash;a cheer from friend
and opponent alike&mdash;a cheer for defeated Randall&mdash;for
Randall that had not conquered, but
had been conquered. Then the players filed to
their dressing rooms.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>BITTER DAYS</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Shall we look up the girls?&rdquo; asked Phil
softly, as he clasped his arm in that of Tom&rsquo;s, and
limped with him from the rooms under the grandstand.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll want to see us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to see them!&rdquo; exclaimed the
end, half fiercely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see anybody.
I want to go off in the dark somewhere, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped, for he felt a raging spirit within
him that he knew was not good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough, old man,&rdquo; spoke Phil, softly, &ldquo;but
maybe it will be best for old Randall in the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best nothing! It never would have happened
if we&rsquo;d had you and Sid on the team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it might.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Tom would not have it so, and clung to
the dispute until someone started an argument
about the referee&rsquo;s ruling on a certain point, and
then the subject was quickly changed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better come over and see the girls,&rdquo; urged
Phil again, as he walked along on his crutch. &ldquo;Sid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
will want to know what they said, and you know
he can&rsquo;t get out for a couple of days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; Tom almost snapped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t rub it in&mdash;they&rsquo;ll know how we
feel,&rdquo; went on the quarter-back. And to the credit
of Ruth, Madge and Mabel, be it said that though
they were Fairview girls, and their college had
downed Randall, which had not happened in a
blue moon before, they never so much as &ldquo;looked&rdquo;
the triumph they must have felt. They knew the
bitterness of defeat, and&mdash;well, they were wise
little damsels.</p>

<p>They talked of anything but football, though
the reference to Phil&rsquo;s injury and to Sid&rsquo;s illness
naturally verged on it. Then they got on safer
ground, and, as Tom walked along with Ruth,
while Phil had Madge Tyler on one side and
Mabel Harrison on the other, the bitterness, in
a measure, passed from them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do up Boxer Hall twice as bad!&rdquo; predicted
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Phil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll play then,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t boast!&rdquo; called his sister, with a laugh.</p>

<p>The girls sent messages of condolence to Sid.
Tom and Phil hurried to tell their chum all about
it. Sid had improved enough to enable him to be
moved to their room, and there, with him in bed,
the game was played all over again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the poor playing of any one man,
or any two or three men,&rdquo; declared Tom. &ldquo;It
was the fault of the whole team. We&rsquo;re crippled,
that&rsquo;s what we are, and we&rsquo;ve got to get in shape
for the rest of the season, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The possibility was not to be mentioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose anything like this would happen
again in years, that we&rsquo;d lose so many players,&rdquo;
spoke Phil. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t always play in luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kindlings feels it pretty fierce,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t talk when he came off the field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s got him bad,&rdquo; agreed Phil. &ldquo;Well,
we&rsquo;ll have to do better, that&rsquo;s all. I think Simpson
is booked for good on the &rsquo;varsity, after the
dandy game he put up in the second half.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came from Tom. &ldquo;The Snail means all
right, but he&rsquo;s too slow. Frank will help the team
a whole lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me about his playing,&rdquo; urged Sid, and
they gave it to him, point by point.</p>

<p>There were bitter days for Randall following
the Fairview game, and for a time it seemed that
the defeat would work havoc with the team. But
Mr. Lighton was a wise coach, and he only
laughed at the gloomy predictions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll come into our own, soon,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;Get right into practice, and keep it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil was able to be in his old place a couple of
days later, and Sid was soon off the sick list, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
that the team was once more in shape. Simpson
was voted a &ldquo;find,&rdquo; and showed up well at guard.
Bascome also improved under the influence of the
presence of the big Californian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think we&rsquo;re gradually getting into
shape again, captain,&rdquo; remarked the coach to
Kindlings one day, after some hard practice, during
which the scrub had been &ldquo;pushed all over the
field, and had its nose rubbed in the dirt,&rdquo; as Holly
Cross picturesquely expressed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Dan Woodhouse. &ldquo;We miss
Bricktop and Ed Kerr, but what can&rsquo;t be cured
must be put up in pickles, as the old woman said
when she kissed the broom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cow, you mean,&rdquo; corrected the coach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I make my own proverbs,&rdquo; replied Kindlings,
with a laugh. &ldquo;They keep better. But, seriously,
I think we will shape up pretty well for the Boxer
game. We&rsquo;ve got a couple of contests in between,
one with the Waram Prep, and the other with
Duncan College. We will take both of those, and
that will make the boys feel better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a little victory, now and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makes good dressing on your salad,&rdquo; finished
Dan, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Though football took up much of the time of
our heroes, with Phil and Sid again on the active
list, they had not forgotten their quest after their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
beloved chair, nor had they given up their plan
of discovering who took the clock.</p>

<p>But, as the days passed, our friends were no
nearer a solution than they had been in the past.
They kept watch on Bascome and Lenton, but
nothing developed, and they did not like to make
any inquiries.</p>

<p>The bitterness of the Fairview defeat still lingered
like a bad taste, in the mouth of the Randall
gridiron knights, but it was being overshadowed
by the game which would soon be played
with Boxer Hall. This season they would clash
but once with those doughty warriors, and according
to the games that had thus far been
played in the Tonoka Lake League, the championship
was practically a tie between Randall and
Boxer Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we win all our other games, and we&rsquo;re likely
to do that,&rdquo; said Kindlings, &ldquo;all we need to do is
to wallop Boxer Hall, and the championship is
ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; remarked Dutch Housenlager.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easily said, but not so easy to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out, you old catamaran!&rdquo; cried Holly
Cross.</p>

<p>It was one morning at chapel, following the annual
reunion of the &ldquo;Old Grads&rdquo; of Randall, that
President Churchill made an announcement that
caused quite a sensation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have bad news to announce,&rdquo; he said, as he
stood on the platform after the devotional exercises.
&ldquo;There has been a conference between our
lawyers and those representing the claimants to
our land. They demand twenty thousand dollars
in settlement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a gasp of surprise that went around
the chapel like a wave of hysteria among a lot of
girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty thousand dollars!&rdquo; whispered Tom
Parsons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Randall can never pay it,&rdquo; remarked Sid, who
sat next to him.</p>

<p>Dr. Churchill waited for the murmurs to cease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need hardly add,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that it is
out of the question for us to pay this sum. Yet,
if we do not, we may lose all that we hold dear,&rdquo;
and the president seemed much affected. &ldquo;However,
we have not given up the fight, and there
may yet be a loophole of escape. You may now
go to your classes.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>MOSES IN PHYSICS</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows, have you heard the news?&rdquo;
burst out Dutch Housenlager one morning after
chapel, about a week following the announcement
about the twenty thousand dollars being demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;News? What news?&rdquo; inquired Holly Cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has the lawsuit been called off?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or has Bricktop Molloy decided to come back
to play on the eleven?&rdquo; demanded Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither one, but we&rsquo;re in for no end of a
lark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. If there&rsquo;s anything funny in the
wind, you can depend on Dutch to ferret it out,&rdquo;
spoke Phil. &ldquo;Well, what is it now, you old Hollander?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prof. Newton is down with the pip, or something,
and can&rsquo;t take his chemistry or physics
classes to-day. They&rsquo;re shy one other teacher,
so Prexy is going to handle the physics recitation.
What a cinch it&rsquo;ll be! I&rsquo;m not up in mine, but
Moses is sure to ask us where the lesson is. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
won&rsquo;t do a thing but steer him back to one we
had a week ago. Then I&rsquo;ll be safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can, if you like,&rdquo; spoke Tom, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
not going to. I&rsquo;ve got mine, and it&rsquo;s a shame to
put one over Moses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, what&rsquo;s the harm?&rdquo; demanded Dutch. &ldquo;It
will amount to the same thing in the end. Now
don&rsquo;t go to spoiling my fun. I&rsquo;m not up, I tell
you, and I don&rsquo;t want to get any more crosses
than I have. My record won&rsquo;t stand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you can do the funny work,&rdquo; declared
Phil. &ldquo;If he asks any of us&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sing out about a back lesson,&rdquo; interrupted
Dutch. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be safe. Anyhow, Moses will
be sure to ask about three questions, and they will
remind him of something about Sanskrit or modern
Chinese, and he&rsquo;ll swing into a talk about what
the ancient Babylonians did in war time. Then
you fellows will call me blessed, for you won&rsquo;t
have any physics to prepare to-morrow, when
Prof. Newton will likely be back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have it your own way,&rdquo; spoke Holly Cross.</p>

<p>As usual when there occurred a change in the
routine of lectures or classes there was more or
less of a spirit of unrest or mischief among the
students. Those in the natural science division
filed into the room where Professor Newton usually
held sway, and it was quickly whispered about
that &ldquo;Moses&rdquo; would appear to hear them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>The venerable president entered with his usual
book under his arm, for he studied early and late&mdash;harder
than the &ldquo;greasiest dig that ever kept
the incandescent going,&rdquo; to quote Holly Cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, young gentlemen,&rdquo; began Dr. Churchill,
blandly, &ldquo;I presume you are surprised to see me,
but your instructor is ill, and I will endeavor to
take his place. You are&mdash;er&mdash;you are in advanced
science, are you not? I believe I have the
right class,&rdquo; and the good doctor, somewhat puzzled,
consulted a memorandum slip in his hand.
&ldquo;Yes, this is the class,&rdquo; he went on, with an air
of relief. &ldquo;Now, to-day&rsquo;s lesson was to be on&mdash;er&mdash;I&rsquo;m
afraid I have forgotten. Professor
Newton told me, but it has slipped my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was exactly what Dutch Housenlager had
counted on, and he was ready to take advantage
of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But of course,&rdquo; continued the president, with
a smile, &ldquo;you students will know where it is.&rdquo;
He opened the physics book, and leafed it over,
as though the lesson would be disclosed to him
in some supernatural way. All eyes turned to
Dutch, for his impending game had become whispered
about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s page three hundred forty-seven,
Dr. Churchill,&rdquo; said Dutch, mentioning a lesson
about a week old.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; went on the president. &ldquo;I see. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
has to do with heat and cold, sudden changes of
temperature and the effects produced by each.
Very interesting, very. I trust you are all prepared?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we aren&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; murmured Dutch, for
they had recited on it several times in review.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speaking of the changes produced by sudden
changes of temperature, can you give me a common
example?&rdquo; asked the president, his eyes roving
about the room. Dutch seemed so eager to
recite, and have it done with, that his agitation
could not but be noticed. &ldquo;You may answer, Mr.
Housenlager,&rdquo; finished Dr. Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ice and snow,&rdquo; came the ready reply. Dutch
breathed easy again. He thought he was done for
the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; continued Dr. Churchill easily,
&ldquo;but that is a little <i>too</i> common. I referred to the
Prince Rupert drops. I dare say you all know
what they are. Mr. Housenlager, you will kindly
explain to the class how they are made, the effect
they produce, and what principle they illustrate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor sat down, and all eyes were once
more turned toward Dutch. Nearly every lad in
the class could have given some sort of answer, for
they had seen the curious glass drops broken by
their regular teacher. But, as it happened, Dutch
had been absent when that subject came up, and,
as he made it a practice never to inquire what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
went on in the lecture room when he was not present,
he was wholly at sea regarding the drops. He
had a hazy idea regarding them, however, and
resolved to hazard a recitation. It was better than
complete failure.</p>

<p>As &ldquo;every schoolboy&rdquo; (to quote a well known
authority) knows what the Prince Rupert drops
are, I will only state that they are globules of
glass, pear shaped, with a long thin &ldquo;tail&rdquo; of the
same brittle material. They are formed by dropping
molten glass into water. The outside cools
quickly, a long tail is formed, and there results
an unequal strain on the glass, because the outside
part has cooled faster than the inside. The
instant a small part of the &ldquo;tail&rdquo; is broken off, the
entire drop crumbles to glass-dust, the pressure
once more being equalized.</p>

<p>It was this object and phenomenon that Dutch
was called on to recite about. He rose in his
seat, and began with an air of confidence that he
did not feel:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Rupert drops illustrate the power of hot
water or steam. They are globules of glass, filled
with water, and, when they are heated, they burst
to pieces, showing the expansive force of heat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The class wanted to roar. Dr. Churchill raised
his eyebrows in surprise. Dutch had described another
glass object used in the class room, and his
explanation of that had been correct, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
as different from a Prince Rupert drop as a ham
sandwich is from chicken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;um,&rdquo; mused the president, putting on his
glasses, and gazing at Dutch through them. &ldquo;Very
interesting, Mr. Housenlager&mdash;very&mdash;but&mdash;hardly
what I asked you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er I&mdash;er&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not prepared,
sir,&rdquo; stammered the fun-loving youth, and the
smiles went round the class.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too bad&mdash;don&rsquo;t you want to try again?&rdquo;
asked the president.</p>

<p>Dutch thought, and thought hard, but the more
he tried to use his brain, the more foreign Prince
Rupert seemed to him. He gave it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Failure,&rdquo; murmured Dr. Churchill, as he
marked it down against Dutch. &ldquo;You may try,
Parsons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom gave the right answer. Dutch gave a
gasp of surprise, and it was noticed that he paid
very close attention to the rest of the lesson. But
it did not go much farther, for, as Dutch had predicted,
the president soon got on a strain that
interested him, and, ignoring the text book, which
was opened at the wrong page, he swept into a
talk on something about as far from physics as is
bookkeeping.</p>

<p>But the &ldquo;goose of Dutch had been done to a
lovely brown,&rdquo; once more quoting Holly Cross.
His trick had turned against him, for, had he given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the proper page, or had he allowed anyone else
to do so, the chances are that he would not have
been called on. He made himself conspicuous,
and so fell before the good doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Dutch,&rdquo; remarked Holly, as they filed
from the room, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you want to try it on again
in our Latin class?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut it out!&rdquo; advised Dutch gruffly, as he
marched on. &ldquo;I know when I&rsquo;ve had enough.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>THE DANCE CARD</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;You look all right, Sid; you&rsquo;ll pass!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; and Sid Henderson
swung around from the mirror over his bureau,
with a somewhat guilty flush on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said you&rsquo;d do,&rdquo; repeated Tom, with a mischievous
grin, as he stood in the doorway of the
room, having paused in the act of entering. &ldquo;What
were you doing, putting on a beauty mark, or looking
to see if you needed a shave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was trying to get my tie straight,&rdquo; growled
Sid, as he fastened his low cut vest, for he was in
his evening clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out, you musty old misogynist!&rdquo; exploded
Phil, following Tom into the room. &ldquo;We know
what you were doing, all right. You wanted to
see if you were good-looking enough, so that you
could dance with Mabel all the evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid looked around for something to throw at his
tormenting roommates, but nothing was handy.
Besides, he might crack the stiff bosom of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
shirt, the snowy expanse of which reflected back
the glow of the incandescent light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you fellows are going to the racket, it&rsquo;s
about time you togged up,&rdquo; went on Sid, as he
carefully took a seat in a chair. He did not sink
luxuriously onto the sofa this time, for fear of
&ldquo;mussing himself up,&rdquo; as Holly Cross would have
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll be ready in jig time!&rdquo; cried Phil,
throwing his coat on one chair, his vest on another,
and, almost before the garments had landed in
&ldquo;artistic confusion,&rdquo; he was changing his shoes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We went to a football meeting,&rdquo; explained
Tom, as he shed his ordinary raiment and proceeded
to &ldquo;tog up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything doing?&rdquo; asked Sid, as he manicured
his nails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, for the love of tripe! Look at him!&rdquo;
cried Phil, with his head half way through a clean
shirt. &ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;d think he was going to a coming-out
party, instead of to a Fairview frat. dance.
Oh, Tom, is my back hair on straight?&rdquo; and Phil,
who had uttered the last in a shrill falsetto voice,
tried to look at the after-portion of his shock of
football hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, when you fellows know how to act like
gentlemen instead of like a bunch of rough-necks,
I&rsquo;ll talk to you,&rdquo; spoke Sid, with dignity. &ldquo;I asked
you a question, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, about the football meeting,&rdquo; went on
the end. &ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t get on your ear just
because we jollied you a little. Stand the gaff
like a man. No, there wasn&rsquo;t much doing. We
talked over some new plays. Incidentally we tried
to explain the slump Randall seems to be up
against, but we couldn&rsquo;t. Where were you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask him. He was up here fussing worse
than a girl,&rdquo; broke in Phil. &ldquo;Hannibal&rsquo;s henpecked
hyperbolas! But do you remember the time, Tom,
when we couldn&rsquo;t get Sid to look at a girl, much
less to take one to a dance? Now he feels hurt
if he doesn&rsquo;t do the Cubanola Glide with one at
least once a week. Vanity, thy name is Sid Henderson!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, cheese it, for cats&rsquo; sake!&rdquo; begged Sid, in
despair. Then Phil, who seemed to take delight
in &ldquo;rigging&rdquo; his chum, glanced at the battered old
alarm clock, which was again on duty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cæsar&rsquo;s grandmother!&rdquo; cried the quarter-back.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be late,&rdquo; and forthwith he began to make motions
&ldquo;like a fellow dressing in a hurry,&rdquo; as he
said afterward, and Sid was left in peace to complete
his immaculate attire, while Tom, too, seeing
the need of haste, left off &ldquo;badgering&rdquo; Sid.</p>

<p>It was the occasion of one of the several dances
that the girls of Fairview Institute had arranged,
and to which they were allowed to ask their
friends. Of course, Miss Philock, the preceptress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
was chief chaperone, and there were other elderly
teachers who took part.</p>

<p>Tom, Phil and Sid, together with a number of
other students from Randall, had been invited, and
this was the evening when &ldquo;event number six, in
the free-for-all-catch-as-catch-can style of dancing
would be pulled off,&rdquo; as Holly Cross remarked,
when he was preparing for it. It was about a week
after Dr. Churchill had so taken the wind out of
the sails of Dutch Housenlager in the physics
class, and in the meanwhile life at the college had
gone on much as usual.</p>

<p>The affair took place in the Fairview gymnasium,
which was appropriately decorated for the
purpose. Tom and his three chums&mdash;for Frank
Simpson went with them&mdash;had called for Miss
Tyler and her friends, Ruth and Mabel. Frank
was to escort a new girl, Miss Helen Warden, to
the dance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a little late,&rdquo; chided Ruth, as she
greeted her brother and the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Sid&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; asserted Phil, with a wink
at Tom. &ldquo;He <i>would</i> insist on changing his togs
at the last minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the hairdresser disappointed him, and
he had to curl it himself,&rdquo; put in Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; spluttered Sid, and then he
choked back his justifiable wrath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind them,&rdquo; sympathized Mabel Harrison.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
&ldquo;We know some secrets as well as they,
Sid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll get back at &rsquo;em some time,&rdquo; predicted
the stocky half-back.</p>

<p>There was quite a throng at the dance when our
friends arrived, and shortly after the girls came
from the dressing rooms, the orchestra began a
dreamy waltz. The lads led out their partners,
and the gymnasium presented a brilliant and animated
scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see him?&rdquo; called Tom to Phil, as the
two young men and their pretty partners swung
near each other in the middle of the big waxed
floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Phil, slowing up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Langridge,&rdquo; was the reply, and then they were
too far apart for more conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, did <i>he</i> come?&rdquo; asked Ruth of Tom,
and she seemed distressed. &ldquo;I do hope he and
Phil&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No danger,&rdquo; interrupted Tom. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep
clear of him. What girl has he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine. I&rsquo;ll look when I see him dancing
with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom pointed out his former enemy, as he swung
his partner around again, and Ruth exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s that new girl! Miss Rossmore is
her name. I guess she doesn&rsquo;t know Mr. Langridge&mdash;very
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; agreed Tom, and then the
dance came to an end in a crash of melody. There
was applause for an encore, and once more the
strains were taken up, and the youths and maidens
were treading the misty mazes of the waltz.</p>

<p>The custom prevailed at these fraternal society
affairs of the lads taking their partners&rsquo; dance programmes
and filling the cards for them. This was
usually done in advance, and insured a girl plenty
of dancers with partners of whom her escort approved.
For he would only put down, or allow
their owners to, the names of his own friends. It
was a sort of &ldquo;clearing-house&rdquo; of dances, and the
lads lobbied among themselves, and &ldquo;split&rdquo; numbers
with each other at their own sweet will, in
order to &ldquo;fill in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get one more partner for you,&rdquo;
remarked Tom, when the second half of the waltz
had come to an end. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a moment,&rdquo;
and leading Ruth over to where her friends were
seated, Tom scurried off toward some of his
chums, in order to impress one of them into service
for his fair partner. There was one vacant
waltz on her card, and Tom himself had been
booked for that number with Miss Tyler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want one for Miss Clinton,&rdquo; called the
pitcher, as he slid into the group of his chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put me down!&rdquo; exclaimed Jerry Jackson eagerly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s one of the best waltzers here. Put
me down, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and Tom reached in his pocket for
the card. It was not there, and a puzzled look
came over his face. &ldquo;Jove, I must have lost it!&rdquo;
he exclaimed blankly, as he looked back over the
route he had taken. As he did so he saw Garvey
Gerhart approaching, holding out one of the dance
orders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you dropped this,&rdquo; murmured the crony
of Langridge. &ldquo;I just picked it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks&mdash;very much,&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, in relief,
and taking the card, he had the Jersey twin
scribble his name on the only vacant line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I put our friend Jerry down for you,&rdquo; he explained
to Ruth, as he joined her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s that
lovely two-step. I can&rsquo;t dance that enough!&rdquo; and
her little foot tapped the floor impatiently. Tom
led her out as the music welled forth.</p>

<p>All too soon it was nearing the end of the little
affair, for, though it was not late, the rules of Fairview
forbade any extended festivities. Tom, who
had been dancing with Miss Harrison, was walking
over to claim Ruth for the next number, when
he saw Langridge stepping toward her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound him!&rdquo; thought Tom, an angry flush
mounting to his face, &ldquo;is he going to speak to her
again?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was evidently the intention of the former
Randall bully. He was smiling at Phil&rsquo;s sister,
who at first did not notice him. Langridge and
Tom reached her at about the same time, and what
was our hero&rsquo;s surprise to hear his enemy say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe this is our dance, Miss Clinton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned in astonishment, a wave of color
surging into her fair face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our dance&mdash;yours&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have your name down on my card,&rdquo; went on
Langridge calmly, &ldquo;and I believe if you will look
at yours that you will find mine on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hastily Ruth caught up her dance order, which
dangled from her fan. As she scanned the names,
the color of her face deepened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;it&mdash;it <i>is</i> here,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;I did not know&mdash;Tom, did you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most certainly <i>not</i>!&rdquo; declared Tom, as emphatically
as he could without attracting too much
attention. &ldquo;I think you are mistaken, Mr. Langridge,&rdquo;
he added stiffly. &ldquo;I booked no dance for
Miss Clinton with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you had better look at the card,&rdquo; replied
the bully, sneeringly.</p>

<p>Tom gave it a hasty glance. There was no
doubt of it. There, in bold writing, on a line
where he was sure he had scribbled his own name,
was that of Langridge. It was the last dance but
two, and Tom had the last one. He was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
sure he had this one, and yet the name of his
enemy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be some mistake,&rdquo; he said, in confusion,
for sometimes mistakes would occur in the
indiscriminate trading of cards among friends.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure I never gave you that card to fill
out, Mr. Langridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bully shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that you figure in this at all,&rdquo; he
said, with a sneering air. &ldquo;I have this dance with
Miss Clinton. May I have the honor?&rdquo; and he
bowed gracefully to the confused girl, and held out
his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began, in distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is not your dance,&rdquo; declared Tom, glaring
at Langridge, reaching out his hand toward his
own partner.</p>

<p>The rivals faced each other. Rivals again,
though on a different field than the baseball diamond.
An angry light gleamed in Tom&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;on
the face of Langridge there was a supercilious
sneer. They stood thus, at one side of the ballroom
floor. The music was playing softly, and
some were dancing, but the impending scene between
Tom and Langridge was attracting attention.</p>

<p>Ruth realized it, and was very much distressed.
Tom was determined not to give way, but he realized
that to make further claim against Langridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
would have the effect of causing a most unpleasant
affair. He felt that there was something wrong
somewhere.</p>

<p>It was Frank Simpson who saved the day. The
big Californian had seen at a distance what took
place, and had guessed what was going on. Also
he had overheard a little of the conversation, and
he was able to fill in the rest.</p>

<p>He sauntered slowly up to the trio, and, with an
air of good fellowship, which he assumed for the
occasion, he clapped Langridge lightly on the back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, old man!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet
soon on the gridiron, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Langridge stiffly, turning
aside. &ldquo;Miss Clinton, will you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He paused
suggestively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; whispered Tom. &ldquo;Your name never
got on her card right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; almost hissed Langridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it is you who must take care!&rdquo; broke in
Simpson, leaning forward as if he was talking on
ordinary topics to the three. The crowd saw, and
taking the very view of the little gathering that the
big Californian wished them to, they turned aside.
&ldquo;It is <i>you</i> who must take care, Mr. Langridge,&rdquo;
went on Frank. &ldquo;I saw you write your name on
Miss Clinton&rsquo;s card.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; The bully&rsquo;s eyes blazed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy now,&rdquo; cautioned Simpson, in calm tones.
&ldquo;Tom, you dropped your partner&rsquo;s card a while
ago, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; The end was beginning to understand
now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I happened to be standing behind a pillar,&rdquo;
went on Frank, &ldquo;when I saw Langridge pick it up.
I saw him erase a name and substitute another, but
I thought nothing of it at the time, as lots of the
fellows had girls&rsquo; cards, filling them out. Then I
saw Mr. Langridge hand the dance order to a
friend of his, who started toward you with it,
Tom, just as you discovered your loss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gerhart&mdash;he handed it to me!&rdquo; gasped Tom.
&ldquo;I see now! Langridge, you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He tried to play a sneaking trick, and was
caught at it!&rdquo; broke in Simpson. &ldquo;Now, Mr.
Langridge, I&rsquo;d advise you to leave this dance!&rdquo;
and the voice of the big Californian grew stern
as he looked full into the eyes of Langridge.</p>

<p>Without a word, but with a glance of hate at
Tom, the bully swung around and crossed the
room, threading his way amid the dancers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, old man!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, fervently,
to Frank. &ldquo;You save us&mdash;saved Miss Clinton&mdash;an
unpleasant time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed you did,&rdquo; spoke Ruth, holding out her
little hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I can repay you.
I did not look at my card when Tom handed it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
back to me, but when I saw&mdash;saw that name there,
I&mdash;I knew I had never let him put it down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, taking the order. He
scratched out the offending name. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone
now,&rdquo; he added, with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am in your debt, Mr. Simpson,&rdquo; went on
Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then repay me sometime by saving a dance
for me,&rdquo; spoke the lad from the Golden West, as
he bowed and moved away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think this is our dance&mdash;<i>now</i>!&rdquo; spoke Tom,
with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;Tom!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, &ldquo;I&mdash;I think
I&rsquo;d rather sit it out.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>THE LEGAL BATTLE</small></h2>


<p>Langridge left the gymnasium immediately
after the unpleasant scene, and Gerhart soon followed.
In a manner, the evening had been partly
spoiled for Ruth, but her girl chums gathered
around her, and succeeded in bringing back a
smile to her face.</p>

<p>She and Tom &ldquo;sat out&rdquo; the dance over which
there had been a dispute, and in a palm bower
they talked of many things. Miss Clinton begged
off from her partner in next to the last dance, but
she did the closing number with Tom, who wished
that the music would never cease.</p>

<p>But the dance finally came to an end with a crash
of melody, and though the youths and maidens applauded
vigorously, the tired musicians put away
their instruments and departed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; spoke Tom, regretfully, as he
escorted his fair companion toward the dressing
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it was&mdash;glorious while it lasted!&rdquo; she
exclaimed, with brightly sparkling eyes. She was
herself again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When is the next one?&rdquo; he asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you greedy boy!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you
know, however. We can&rsquo;t have them too often.
The ogress objected to this one, as it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning Miss Philock?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one else. I&rsquo;ll be out soon, and then we&rsquo;ll
go home. There are Madge and Mabel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom and his friends went to have a final cup
of coffee, before starting off with the girls, and
while they were drinking the beverage, Frank
Simpson remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we ought to know this week whether
we&rsquo;re going to have a Randall College any more
or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The real legal battle opens in court to-morrow.
I heard Dr. Churchill telling Mr. Zane about it
this afternoon. It seems there is a certain point
to be argued before they get at the main issue, and
whichever side wins this point will have the advantage,
and practically get the case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of a point is it?&rdquo; asked Tom, who
had a little leaning toward the law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blessed if I know?&rdquo; replied the Californian.
&ldquo;It was too deep for me, though I heard Moses
mention it. There was something about a writ of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
<i>certiorari</i> or <i>lis pendis</i> or an injunction, or something
like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe the college authorities are going to ask
for an injunction to prevent Langridge and that
crowd from interfering until the football season
is over,&rdquo; suggested Holly Cross, hopefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Do you imagine that all Moses and
the others have to think of is football?&rdquo; demanded
Phil. &ldquo;I tell you, fellows, this is a serious matter.
I&rsquo;d hate to see old Randall done away with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So would we all,&rdquo; declared Kindlings. &ldquo;But
maybe we&rsquo;ll win in court, just as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we didn&rsquo;t against Fairview, but as we&rsquo;re
going to do against Boxer Hall!&rdquo; interrupted
Tom, with energy, and then he saw Ruth beckoning
to him, as she stood with her chums, most
bewitchingly arrayed in a fur coat. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;
called Tom to his friends, and soon they were
escorting the girls home.</p>

<p>There was some expectation when the students
at Randall assembled in chapel the next morning,
and it was borne out by an announcement Dr.
Churchill made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps some of you have heard of the further
rumors going about concerning our difficulties,&rdquo;
he said, gravely. &ldquo;I beg of you to pay
no attention to them. The case is far from settled,
though within two days it may progress much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
toward that end, either for us&mdash;or against us. I
now wish to state,&rdquo; he went on, after a pause,
&ldquo;that the faculty as well as the directors have
been summoned to court to-morrow and the following
day, so that Randall will be without a
teaching force. You young gentlemen will be
given two holidays from your lectures and studies,
but I request that none of you leave the vicinity
of the college in that time. Mr. Zane will be
in charge. I believe that is all,&rdquo; and the president
bowed to the students.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! Think of it! Two days off!&rdquo; whispered
Dutch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll practice football as you never did before,&rdquo;
declared Kindlings with energy. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
going to be all cakes and ginger ale for you,
Dutch, my lad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was much jubilation among the students
at the prospect of an unexpected vacation, and
even that day, preceding the two days&rsquo; holiday,
the spirit of unrest was manifested, so that lectures
suffered.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, President Churchill and
the entire faculty took the train for the county
seat, where the legal battle would be fought in
the courthouse. The president and the instructors
were needed to give evidence as to how long
Randall had been in undisturbed possession of the
land, as the college lawyers hoped thus to prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
their right to it, even without the lost quit-claim
deed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, young gentlemen,&rdquo; began Proctor Zane,
when the authorities had departed, &ldquo;I shall expect
implicit obedience from all of you in this emergency.
I want no skylarking or horseplay,&rdquo; and
as he said that he looked directly at Dutch
Housenlager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, we won&rsquo;t do a thing,&rdquo; promised the
fun-loving lad. &ldquo;Will we, Holly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself. I&rsquo;m going to practice kicking,&rdquo;
declared the big centre, as he walked over
toward the gridiron with a ball under his arm, followed
by a number of the eleven.</p>

<p>Kindlings and the coach took advantage of the
free time to insist on thorough practice, and an
impromptu game was arranged with a nearby
preparatory school for the following day, while
for the present the &rsquo;varsity would have the scrub
as opponents. There was a noticeable improvement
on the part of the regular eleven, and Captain
Woodhouse felt much encouraged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, fellows,&rdquo; remarked Dutch Housenlager,
as he strolled into the room of our four chums
that night, and found Frank Simpson there, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got a great idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, to set the college on fire, transport
it bodily to some other location, or some other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
cute and infantile bit of cutting-up like that?&rdquo;
asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither, you old catamaran! But Zane has
his hands full with the freshman class. Particular
hob has broken loose over in their dormitory,
and &lsquo;Zany&rsquo; is at his wits&rsquo; end. Now, what&rsquo;s the
matter with some of us getting into his room, and
upsetting it a bit, to pay him back for what he&rsquo;s
made us suffer? How&rsquo;s that for a joke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too kiddish,&rdquo; declared Phil. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t
think up anything more lively you&rsquo;d better go to
bed, or join the freshies. Come again, Dutch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, it&rsquo;s a wonder you fellows wouldn&rsquo;t think
up something lively yourselves, once in a while,&rdquo;
protested the big lad. &ldquo;You want me to do it all,
and then you blame me if it doesn&rsquo;t come out
right. Name something yourself, Phil Clinton,&rdquo;
challenged Dutch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, get out, we&rsquo;re going to have a game of
chess,&rdquo; declared Sid. &ldquo;Keep quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you fellows don&rsquo;t want to have a good
time, I&rsquo;m going to,&rdquo; declared Dutch, with an injured
air. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find someone to do the trick with
me, and then you&rsquo;ll wish you&rsquo;d come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fare thee well,&rdquo; mockingly called Tom, after
the departing student.</p>

<p>Dutch managed to get Holly Cross and the two
Jersey twins into his scheme, and the four lads,
after ascertaining that the proctor was busily engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
trying to bring order out of chaos in the
freshmen ranks, made for Mr. Zane&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make him think a cyclone has broken
loose,&rdquo; declared Dutch, gleefully. &ldquo;It will be
rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Mr. Zane was the personification of neatness.
His room was as well arranged as the stateroom
of the captain on an ocean liner. There was
a place for everything, and everything was always
in its place.</p>

<p>But the mischief-making students had not been
inside more than three minutes, before the apartment
did indeed look as though a looting burglar
had been at work. Drawers of bureaus were pulled
out, books were scattered all about, the chairs
were piled up on the tables, a couch was turned
over, and some of the incandescent light bulbs
removed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s turn every picture with the face to
the wall,&rdquo; proposed Dutch, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; declared Joe Jackson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Immense!&rdquo; echoed his brother.</p>

<p>They were in the act of turning the etchings and
engravings about face, when there came a sudden
knock at the door. If thunder had sounded in
the room the lads could not have been more surprised.
They looked at each other in consternation.
The knock was repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Co&mdash;come in,&rdquo; stammered Holly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly the portal was pushed open, and, there,
standing in the hall, was Professor Emerson Tines,
with a small valise in his hand.</p>

<p>At the sight of the confusion that reigned in the
proctor&rsquo;s well-ordered apartment a look of amazement
spread itself over the face of the Latin instructor.
His jaw fell, and the valise did likewise.
Then he snapped his teeth together, there
came a glinting light into his eyes, and with a
frosty smile he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening, young gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, as
he stepped into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caught!&rdquo; murmured Dutch, as he let a picture
swing back into place. &ldquo;Caught!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<small>ONE POINT LOST</small></h2>


<p>For a moment there was silence&mdash;portentous,
momentous silence, while &ldquo;Pitchfork&rdquo; gazed at
the astonished lads, and as they returned his stare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked the Latin professor, as he
advanced farther into the room, and looked about
at the confusion on every side, &ldquo;I see that Mr.
Zane is not here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no&mdash;no, sir,&rdquo; answered Dutch, for Mr.
Tines was looking directly at him, and seemed to
expect him to reply. &ldquo;He&mdash;he has gone out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which is evidently the reason <i>you</i> are here,
committing these acts of vandalism!&rdquo; said the professor,
bitterly. &ldquo;I am ashamed of you! To
think that Dr. Churchill, myself and the other
teachers could not go away for two days without
you students behaving yourselves like this, it is
disgraceful, shameful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke as though the whole responsibility of
the college rested upon himself and the venerable
president, whereas it was common knowledge that
the plan was being considered of dropping Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Tines and getting a more popular professor, as
well as a proctor who was more in sympathy with
the boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we only wanted to have some&mdash;some
fun,&rdquo; went on Dutch, who, having acted as leader
in the prank, thought it was his duty to defend
his friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fun!&rdquo; burst out Mr. Tines. &ldquo;Do you call
this disgraceful vandalism <i>fun</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we meant it as such,&rdquo; went on Dutch.</p>

<p>Professor Tines only sniffed. Probably he did
not know what else to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You young gentlemen&mdash;I had almost said ruffians,&rdquo;
he finally remarked, &ldquo;you will remain here
until I return. Perhaps you may be able to tell
me where Mr. Zane is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think he is in the freshmen dormitory,&rdquo;
replied Holly Cross, who had been puzzling his
brain trying to think of a reason for the unexpected
return of Mr. Tines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, thank you. I will find him, and return
here. <i>You</i> will kindly remain. I wish him to see
his room&mdash;<i>as it is</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Tines turned about stiffly, and left.
The four lads gathered together in the centre of
the apartment, a miserable and forlorn quartette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d have thought he&rsquo;d show up?&rdquo; demanded
Dutch, as if it was against the rules for
such a thing to be done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; declared Jerry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me either,&rdquo; echoed his twin brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he caught us with the goods, all right,&rdquo;
said Holly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I wonder what he&rsquo;ll do&mdash;he and Zany?&rdquo;
ventured Dutch. &ldquo;Shall we stay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got to,&rdquo; was Holly&rsquo;s opinion, and indeed the
request of the professor was equivalent to a command&mdash;under
the circumstances.</p>

<p>They waited there in misery until the Latin
instructor and Mr. Zane came. The gasp of astonishment
and dismay that the proctor gave as he
saw his room was evidence enough of the manner
in which he viewed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is what I found them at when I returned&mdash;most
unexpectedly,&rdquo; said Mr. Tines, with a
wave of his hand toward the shrinking youths.
&ldquo;If I were in your place, Mr. Zane, I would make
them restore everything to rights, and then inflict
such punishment as would cover the case. Disbarment
from athletics would be none too severe,
as I see that all these are members of the football
team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a gasp of dismay from the four, they
had not bargained for that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came back unexpectedly,&rdquo; went on the professor.
&ldquo;Dr. Churchill had forgotten some papers
to be used in the lawsuit, and I volunteered to
return for them. Getting here unexpectedly, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
looked for you, Mr. Zane. I knocked at your
door. I was bidden to enter. This&mdash;this&mdash;&rdquo; and
the professor made a dramatic gesture, &ldquo;this is
what I beheld,&rdquo; and he waved his two hands hopelessly
at the confusion.</p>

<p>As yet the proctor had said nothing. He looked
at his dismantled room as though he could not
comprehend it. Never&mdash;never had he beheld it in
this way before, not even when he moved from
one apartment to another, nor when a section of
the building in which he had his study was rebuilt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was in the freshman dormitory&mdash;there was a
little&mdash;ahem&mdash;a little difficulty there,&rdquo; and the
proctor hesitated. &ldquo;I had no idea&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were you I would make them put everything
exactly as they found it,&rdquo; interrupted Mr.
Tines, severely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;that is&mdash;I think I would prefer to
straighten matters out myself,&rdquo; said Mr. Zane
hesitatingly. It was as though he was in a daze.
&ldquo;You&mdash;you young gentlemen may go to your
rooms,&rdquo; he added, softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Professor Emerson Tines.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he realized that he was infringing on the
prerogatives of the proctor, and he kept still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may go,&rdquo; said Mr. Zane, softly, and
Dutch and his mates went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not long before the news buzzed in
every dormitory of the college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Served Dutch right,&rdquo; declared Tom. &ldquo;He
ought to have known better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but if Zane and Pitchfork take him and
Holly and the twins off the team,&rdquo; suggested Phil,
&ldquo;then we <i>will</i> be in the soup, for further orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a direful thought, and no one liked to
dwell on it. There was a lot of talk, and much
speculation as to how &ldquo;Pitchfork&rdquo; had managed
to get back unobserved. There were also guesses
as to what would be done with the culprits.</p>

<p>Then something new developed. It concerned
the excitement in the freshman ranks. There had
been considerable horseplay, it was said, and Mr.
Zane had indignantly ordered it stopped. To his
surprise, the students not only obeyed him, but his
pardon was formally asked in the name of the
class, and he was given a ringing round of cheers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> the noise we heard,&rdquo; commented
Tom. &ldquo;I thought they were raising the roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether it was the unexpected compliment paid
to him, or a feeling of commiseration for the
four culprits was not made known, but, at any
rate, Proctor Zane inflicted absolutely no punishment
on Dutch and his mates. He did not even
refer to the subject again, though Professor Tines
was seen in excited conversation with him. Perhaps
the trouble in which Randall was involved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
and a feeling that he was not as well liked as he
might be, influenced Mr. Zane.</p>

<p>So Dutch and his three chums breathed easier,
and the football team blessed its lucky stars that
it was to lose no more men.</p>

<p>Professor Tines went back to court early the
next morning, taking with him the documents forgotten
by the president. He gave out no news of
the court proceedings, which indeed had not been
opened as yet.</p>

<p>But word of them was received on the second
day of the absence of the faculty. It was when
the Randall &rsquo;varsity was returning from the game
with the preparatory school, having won by an unexpectedly
big margin. The players were feeling
jubilant, and were telling each other what they
would do to Boxer Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, there&rsquo;s Prexy!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, as he
saw the venerable president strolling over the
campus toward his residence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask him what happened in court,&rdquo; suggested
Phil. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t mind, for he knows we&rsquo;re
anxious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little squad of players surged up around
Dr. Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell us&mdash;that is&mdash;is Randall safe?&rdquo;
stammered Phil, as he looked up into the President&rsquo;s
face, his mates anxiously surrounding him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I regret to say that we have been defeated in
the first&mdash;ah&mdash;scrimmage, I believe you football
players call it,&rdquo; said the doctor, a bit sadly. &ldquo;We
have lost the first point in the main legal battle.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a><br />
<small>AN UNEXPECTED CLEW</small></h2>


<p>Four lads sat in various ungraceful if easy attitudes
in the room of our heroes one evening.
Four&mdash;for Frank Simpson was now an accredited
member in full and regular standing of the &ldquo;Big
Four,&rdquo; as they were coming to be called.</p>

<p>Frank had moved his belongings into the apartment
of the three chums, who were now four, for
he found their comradeship congenial, and they
liked him immensely.</p>

<p>It was a week after the announcement by Dr.
Churchill of the setback the college had received
in the opening of the legal battle.</p>

<p>Football practice had, naturally, gone on as
usual, and there was a more hopeful look on the
faces of the captain and coach. The team was
playing more as a unit. Kicks were being handled
better, the ball was being advanced with greater
certainty in the games with the scrubs, and it
looked as if Randall would come into her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
again. They had played another minor game, and
had rolled up a surprisingly big score.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the trouble of it is,&rdquo; said Tom, as he got
in a more comfortable position on the creaking
sofa, &ldquo;the trouble of it is that Boxer Hall is doing
just as well. She&rsquo;s cleaning up everything that
comes her way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we have a look-in at the championship,&rdquo;
declared Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if we win the game Saturday against Pentonville
Prep,&rdquo; agreed Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll do that all right,&rdquo; declared Frank.</p>

<p>The football situation in the Tonaka Lake
League was peculiar that year. In spite of the
fact that Randall had not done well and had been
beaten by Fairview, the latter college had
&ldquo;slumped&rdquo; so after her victory over Randall that
she was practically out of it as regards the championship.
Should Randall win the game against
Pentonville, which was almost a foregone conclusion,
there would be a tie between Boxer Hall
and the college of our heroes for the championship.
It was this knowledge which made the players,
coach and captain a trifle nervous, for so much
depended on the final struggle that was close at
hand.</p>

<p>Would it be Randall or Boxer Hall that would
carry off the honors of the gridiron?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll play our heads off, that&rsquo;s all I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
say,&rdquo; remarked Tom, as he glanced over the
sporting pages of a paper. &ldquo;I see that they&rsquo;re
trying some new kicking game at Boxer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re always after fads,&rdquo; declared Phil.
&ldquo;But straight football, with some of the old-fashioned
line bucking, such as we play, and two
halves, are good enough for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; agreed Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess nothing will come of that law business
before the final game, eh, fellows?&rdquo; went on Tom,
who seemed anxious about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No danger of a decision from the courts right
away,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;From what I can hear, our
lawyers are going to get back at Langridge and
his partner in some new kind of an injunction or a
<i>lis pendis</i> or a <i>whang-doodle</i>. That may make it
look like a white horse of another color.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They talked of football and the legal tangle at
some length, and were deep in a discussion about
a certain wing-shift play, when tramping footsteps
were heard down the corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Holly Cross,&rdquo; ventured Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dutch Housenlager or&mdash;an elephant,&rdquo; predicted
Tom. &ldquo;He walks as though he had his
football shoes on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s coming to suggest another trick
on the proctor or Pitchfork,&rdquo; suggested Phil, for
the latest attempt of Dutch was a standing joke
against the fun-loving student.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Dutch!&rdquo; greeted Tom, as the big
guard entered. &ldquo;Anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know, but I thought you looked
as if you just met the proctor, who made you
sweep and dust his room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others joined in the laugh against Dutch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, can you fellows ever forget anything?&rdquo;
he asked, in accents of deep disgust, as he looked
about for a place to sit down. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the seat
of honor, anyhow?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Am I to sit
on the floor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, suit yourself,&rdquo; remarked Phil. &ldquo;Our seat
of honor hasn&rsquo;t yet come back from the realms of
mystery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, hang it all!&rdquo; exclaimed Sid. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a
good deal to know who has our old chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! Haven&rsquo;t you got that back yet?&rdquo; asked
Dutch. &ldquo;Seems to me if I were you I&rsquo;d make it a
point to go in the room of every fellow in college
until I found it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve practically done that,&rdquo; declared Phil.
&ldquo;In fact, we&rsquo;ve done everything but offer a reward,
and I guess we&rsquo;ll have to do that next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what sort of a chair was it that you lost?&rdquo;
asked Frank Simpson. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about
it since I came to Randall, but I don&rsquo;t exactly
know whether it is a Turkish rocker or a Chinese
teakwood affair with a cold marble seat.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the easiest chair you ever sat in!&rdquo; declared
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A regular sleep-producer,&rdquo; was Sid&rsquo;s opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing like it ever known when you came in
all tired out from football practice, as I did to-night,&rdquo;
spoke Phil. &ldquo;It rested you all over, and
now we only have the couch, and Tom or Sid
have that all the time now, so I don&rsquo;t get a chance
at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out, you syndicated cynic!&rdquo; cried Tom.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always on the &lsquo;lay&rsquo; when I come in. But,
Frank, seriously, this chair of ours was the real
thing. It was a beaut, and I haven&rsquo;t been able to
find one like it since. It was an heirloom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a relic of the dark ages!&rdquo; broke in
Dutch. &ldquo;Say, Simpson, you&rsquo;d ought to have seen
it! That chair was broken in the back, the seat
was humped up like a camel with the heaves, both
cylinders were cracked, the gears were stripped
smooth, the differential was on the fritz, there
wasn&rsquo;t a tire on it without a puncture, it had the
pip and the epizootic, and, to crown it all, when
you sat down in it you never knew whether you
were going to get out of it alive or were a prisoner
for life on hard labor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soak him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Traitor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put him out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roll him under the sofa!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do for you, Dutch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were only some of the things that Tom
and his mates called at the big guard as he went
on slandering the precious chair. Frank Simpson
sat an amused witness of the little scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was pretty big, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he ventured, at
length. &ldquo;That chair, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if we were talking of anything else,&rdquo; retorted
Phil. &ldquo;Yes, it was big and heavy and
clumsy&mdash;about fifty years old, I guess, and it disappeared
just before the clock went off on a vacation,
and came back so unexpectedly. By the way,
fellows, we&rsquo;re as far from that mystery as ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it!&rdquo; begged Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did your chair have a sort of reddish-brown
cover on it?&rdquo; went on Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may have been the color once,&rdquo; broke in
the irrepressible Dutch, &ldquo;but it was sky-blue pink
when it walked away, for these fellows used to
empty their ink bottles on it, and use the upholstery
for a blotter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cheese it!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Yes, Frank, the
cover was a reddish-brown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And were the legs carved with claws, and the
arms with lions&rsquo; heads?&rdquo; went on the Californian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly! Say!&rdquo; cried Phil, &ldquo;like the dervish
in the story of the camel, have you got our old
chair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He arose, and fairly glared at Frank. The latter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
too, had been growing more serious as he
proceeded with his questions. Sid and Tom
leaned forward eagerly, and Dutch looked on,
wondering what was coming next.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got your chair,&rdquo; went on Frank, &ldquo;but
when I know what kind it is, as I do now for
the first time, I think I can give you news of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, for the love of Mike and the little
fishes, speak!&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or forever after hold your peace,&rdquo; chimed in
Dutch, solemnly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s our chair?&rdquo; demanded Phil, dramatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was passing a second-hand store, the proprietor
of which also does upholstering as a side line,&rdquo;
went on Frank, &ldquo;when, happening to glance into
the left-hand&mdash;no, I think it was the right-hand&mdash;window,
I espied&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, put on more steam!&rdquo; begged Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw a chair,&rdquo; went on the Californian, &ldquo;a
chair that I am sure must be yours. It was exactly
as you have described it. I thought it looked to
be quite a relic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is that second-hand place?&rdquo; cried Phil
and Tom in a breath, while Sid grew so excited
that he grabbed Frank by the arm, and held to
him as if he, too, might vanish as had the chair.
&ldquo;Where is it? Where is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In Haddonfield, on a little side street that runs
up from the depot. I don&rsquo;t know the name of it,&rdquo;
answered Simpson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Decker Street,&rdquo; supplied Tom. &ldquo;About the
only place we didn&rsquo;t look, fellows. I didn&rsquo;t know
there was a second-hand place there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only this one!&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;But he
has your chair!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;On the trail at last!
Where&rsquo;s my cap?&rdquo; and he began looking about
the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you going, this time of night?&rdquo; demanded
Dutch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over to Haddonfield to get that chair, of
course,&rdquo; replied the quarter-back. &ldquo;Come on, Sid
and Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were enthusiastically hunting about for
their hats and coats, which were never put in the
same place twice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go along and show you,&rdquo; volunteered
Frank. &ldquo;But he may be closed now. It&rsquo;s after
nine. We won&rsquo;t get to town until nearly ten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make him open up if we have to get
the police,&rdquo; declared Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows, it&rsquo;s too late to go to-night,&rdquo; said
Dutch, seriously. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t run any chances of
Zane catching you, especially as the big game with
Boxer is so near at hand. If you&rsquo;re caught it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
mean being ruled off the team, and you ought not
to take chances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The four hesitated. It was their chair against
the eleven, for they knew that there had been a
number of college rule violations of late, and the
proctor was unusually strict. They might be
caught and punished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morning will do,&rdquo; insisted Dutch, who, if he
did not care much for the chair, did have the
interests of the eleven at heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do, but I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to wait,&rdquo;
conceded Phil, slowly. &ldquo;Jove! It&rsquo;s tough to almost
get your hands on it, and then have to hold
back. Why didn&rsquo;t you tell us this before,
Frank?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see the chair in the window until day
before yesterday, and then I never thought it
could be yours, until we got to talking about it
to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And to think that we may have it back to-morrow,&rdquo;
murmured Tom. &ldquo;It seems too good
to be true! I wonder how it ever got away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that, but I do know that we&rsquo;ll
chain it fast when we have it again,&rdquo; declared
Phil, and then they made Frank tell all over again
how he had happened to see it, and how it looked.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI</a><br />
<small>AFTER THE CHAIR</small></h2>


<p>The four chums begged off from football practice
directly after the first lecture the next morning,
when they had a clear period until noon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; demanded Kindlings, to
whom they made the request.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to go to Haddonfield and get our
chair,&rdquo; explained Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you want me to knock out a morning&rsquo;s
practice, when you know how much the team needs
it,&rdquo; went on the captain, reproachfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need it&mdash;so much,&rdquo; declared Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you fellows think you&rsquo;re perfect, I guess,&rdquo;
and the captain looked injured, and spoke sarcastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; said Tom, eagerly, &ldquo;but if we
<i>don&rsquo;t</i> go, our chair may vanish again. We&rsquo;ll put
in hard practice when we come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, then, go ahead,&rdquo; conceded Kindlings,
after a consultation with the coach. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
you pay for it, though. If we lose the Boxer
game, it will be up to you fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t lose!&rdquo; declared Tom, confidently.</p>

<p>They caught the next trolley car for town, and,
piloted by Frank, headed for the second-hand
shop on the little side street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;d better map out a plan of campaign,&rdquo;
suggested Phil, as they neared the place.
&ldquo;If we go into the place, and demand the chair,
the fellow may insist that he has a good claim on
it, and raise a row. We can&rsquo;t take it away by
force, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We sure <i>can</i>!&rdquo; broke in Tom, indignantly.
&ldquo;That chair is our property, and we have a right
to take it wherever we find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose the dealer bought it in good faith
from some one who stole it from our room?&rdquo;
asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That makes no difference,&rdquo; went on Tom, who
thought that perhaps some day he would study
law. &ldquo;If the dealer hasn&rsquo;t a good title to it, he
can&rsquo;t claim it. We can take it away from him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Sid. &ldquo;Get a policeman and
have him ride it away for us in the patrol wagon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we could do that,&rdquo; agreed Frank, &ldquo;but it
would be sure to raise a row, and draw a crowd,
and then folks would blame it on the pranks of
some of the Randall boys. We can&rsquo;t afford to
have that happen. Prexy wouldn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got to get our chair,&rdquo; insisted Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there some sort of a legal way of doing
it?&rdquo; asked Phil. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we go to court and get a
search warrant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What we need, in case we locate the chair, is a
writ of replevin,&rdquo; declared Tom, as if he knew all
the ins and outs of the legal game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is replevin any relation, say a second cousin,
to <i>lis pendis</i>?&rdquo; asked Frank, who seemed to have
a special fondness for that term.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing like it,&rdquo; asserted Tom. &ldquo;To replevin
your goods, it means you get a court order to take
them wherever you can find them. Now my plan
is this: We&rsquo;ll go into the store, look around until
we locate our chair, and then boldly demand it.
If the fellow refuses to give it up we&rsquo;ll go get a
policeman, and swear out a warrant against him
for receiving stolen goods. That&rsquo;s what it
amounts to, and we three fellows are witnesses
enough, and can prove that the chair is ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re with you, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No better plan having been proposed, Tom&rsquo;s
was agreed to, and they proceeded on toward the
shop, having come to a halt to discuss the situation.</p>

<p>Eagerly they peered forward as they swung
around the corner. Each of the three wanted to
be first to sight their beloved chair. As for Frank,
he felt that he had already seen it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the place,&rdquo; suddenly remarked the Californian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
&ldquo;That shop with the spinning wheel
sign over the door. It&rsquo;s a queer old place, kept
by a down-east Yankee, to judge by his talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The worst kind of a fellow with whom to talk
business such as we have,&rdquo; said Sid. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll stand
on his rights to the last inch or penny. But there&rsquo;s
no help for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were almost in front of the place now,
and they strove to appear indifferent&mdash;as though
they were merely strolling by; for, as Tom said,
first they wanted to catch a glimpse of their chair
in the window, and then they would have the evidence
they needed.</p>

<p>Four pairs of eyes were turned simultaneously
toward the dingy casement, in which stood an odd
assortment of chairs, tables, small sofas and other
antique furniture. Four gasps of breath told more
plainly than any words the shock of surprise that
followed the glances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t there!&rdquo; cried Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; added Sid.</p>

<p>Truly enough there was no big, old-fashioned,
easy chair in the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s in the other,&rdquo; suggested Frank.
&ldquo;I told you I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether it was the left
or right window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phil darted across the doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t over here, either!&rdquo; he cried, as a rapid
survey of the contents of that window disclosed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the fact that it contained only some brass warming
pans, a broken spinning wheel, some andirons
and fire tongs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s inside,&rdquo; came from Frank. &ldquo;This
fellow changes his window goods every other day
to attract trade. Let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was nothing else to do after they had
assured themselves, by eager glances through the
windows, that their chair could not be seen from
without.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, gentlemen, what can I do for you to-day?&rdquo;
asked a little wizened man, with a much
wrinkled face, as he came forward, briskly rubbing
his hands. His face was smooth shaven, and
seemed to be made of some kind of upholstery
leather. His blue eyes were deep set, under
shaggy brows. &ldquo;Like something to furnish your
college rooms with?&rdquo; he went on, making a
shrewd and correct guess as to their character.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some sporty things, all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Real sporty, eh?&rdquo; asked Tom. &ldquo;Something
that will make our den look homelike?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. Why, I can sell you a pair of andirons
dirt cheap. Real antiques they be, too. Come
over in the <i>Mayflower</i>. Then I&rsquo;ve got a lot of
Revolutionary muskets and swords you can hang
up on the walls, and make it look like a regular
den. Could you use a spinning wheel? I&rsquo;ve got
a dandy that just came in. I sold one like it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
some girls from Fairview Institute the other day,
and they paid me a good price. I could let you
have this one a little cheaper, if you bought all
your stuff from me. You&rsquo;re from Boxer Hall,
ain&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, from Randall!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil, indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I meant to say Randall all the while!&rdquo; exclaimed
the man, in some confusion. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; into me lately. Guess I need
a new pair of eyes. That&rsquo;s twice I made a mistake
like that. I might have knowed you was from
Randall, of course. You fellers are goin&rsquo; to beat
them all holler in the championship game, ain&rsquo;t
ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We hope so,&rdquo; answered Phil, &ldquo;but we came
to look for an old easy chair. We need one for
our room, and we heard you had one that would
suit us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy chairs for college rooms? Why, I&rsquo;ve
got &rsquo;em by the bushel!&rdquo; exclaimed the man, eager
for business. &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; and he led the way
to the rear of his shop. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em in Colonial
style, early English, Flemish, Louis the Fourteenth,
and almost any kind you like. What&rsquo;ll
you have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chums eagerly looked around the shop.
Their chair was not in sight. Somehow their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
hearts sank, and they hardly dared ask the next
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see a good, old-fashioned, easy chair.
We don&rsquo;t care whether it&rsquo;s early Flemish or late
Irish,&rdquo; said Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something like the one you had in your window
the other day,&rdquo; put in Tom. &ldquo;A friend of
ours saw that one, and told us about it. We&rsquo;d like
to look at that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dealer, who had been marching hopefully
toward the rear of his shop, suddenly paused.
He turned around and looked at the boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you meanin&rsquo; a big chair, with reddish-brown
velour on it, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Claw legs!&rdquo; interrupted Sid, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And lions&rsquo; heads on the arms,&rdquo; put in Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;Where is it? Show
us that one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dealer glanced at them sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now I&rsquo;m monstrous sorry,&rdquo; he began
apologetically, &ldquo;but I just traded that chair&mdash;traded
it last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Traded it?&rdquo; gasped Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last night?&rdquo; echoed Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on the dealer. &ldquo;I had no call for
it. You see, that old-fashioned upholstered stuff
is out of date. What folks want now is real antiques
like Louis the Fourteenth, or Mission.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Mission is great stuff! Now I&rsquo;ve got a Mission
chair, in real Spanish leather, that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you come to trade our chair&mdash;I mean
the one we <i>hoped</i> to call ours,&rdquo; and Phil quickly
corrected himself, for it had been decided they
would make no claim until they had assured themselves
that it was really their chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the fact is a feller who&rsquo;s in the same
line of business as I am wanted it more than I
did,&rdquo; explained the Yankee dealer. &ldquo;He offered
me two spinning wheels for it, and I took him up.
I&rsquo;ve got quite a call for spinning wheels. Them
girls over at Fairview College likes &rsquo;em for their
rooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; murmured Phil, regretfully.
&ldquo;Ruth told me she got one the other day for their
den.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you traded off our&mdash;I mean that easy
chair?&rdquo; went on Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I couldn&rsquo;t get rid of it, so I let it go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you come to get hold of it?&rdquo; asked
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d you trade it to?&rdquo; inquired Frank, and
his question was the more practical. Yet the
dealer answered Tom first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bought it from a Hebrew peddler,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;He come along one day with a load of
stuff, and offered me the chair with some other
things. Said he&rsquo;d been buying &rsquo;em up at different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
colleges around here, and trading stuff for &rsquo;em.
So I took the chair, and it was one of the few
times I&rsquo;ve been stuck. Still, I didn&rsquo;t make out
so bad, as I got the spinning wheels for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you can&rsquo;t show it to us,&rdquo; spoke Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that chair&rsquo;s gone. But I&rsquo;ve got lots of
others. There&rsquo;s one real antique, in horsehair,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thanks!&rdquo; interrupted Phil. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d slide
off that every time we tried to go to sleep, it&rsquo;s so
slippery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s that Mission&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the
dealer, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we want one like that one which was in
the window,&rdquo; spoke Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, with whom did you say you traded
it?&rdquo; asked Frank, casually, as if it did not matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know his name,&rdquo; spoke the dealer.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done some business with him before, but not
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he in Haddonfield?&rdquo; Phil wanted to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s out in the country somewhere. Lives
on a little farm, I believe, and does the furniture
business as a side line. He also upholsters chairs,
I understand. It was some name like Cohen, or
Rosasky, or Isaacs&mdash;I really forget. But now, if
you&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo; for chairs&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; interrupted Tom. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
think we care to look at any to-day. If you could
put us on the track of the one we saw, we might
get that, and then we could buy others of you.&rdquo;
He added this as a bait to the trader.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m very sorry, but I can&rsquo;t, for the life
of me, think of the name of the man who took that
old chair,&rdquo; declared the dealer. &ldquo;But if it was a
spinning wheel now, or something in Mission, I
could&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows,&rdquo; interrupted Tom, sadly.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess we don&rsquo;t want anything to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve got a real gem in Louis the Fourteenth,&rdquo;
went on the man eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Phil, decidedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or early Flemish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing,&rdquo; declared Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or a Colonial sideboard and a warming pan&mdash;a
warming pan is dead swell in the room of a
college lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s jolly him along,&rdquo; whispered Frank Simpson.
&ldquo;We want to get on the trail of that Hebrew.
Now if we buy&mdash;say, a warming pan, of this man,
he may give us more information.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; whispered Tom, eagerly. &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t I think of it myself? Of course! We do
need a warming pan,&rdquo; he went on, winking at
Phil and Sid, who at first thought their chum was
out of his mind. &ldquo;Now if we could get a nice copper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
one, pretty good sized, it might do in place
of the chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For you to sit on,&rdquo; murmured Sid, keeping a
straight face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got just what you want!&rdquo; declared the
dealer, happy now at the prospect of business.
&ldquo;Come back this way to the warming pan department.
I&rsquo;ve got one that came over in the vessel
that followed the <i>Mayflower</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been the <i>Jilliflower</i>,&rdquo; murmured
Sid, with a silent chuckle.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII</a><br />
<small>&ldquo;THIS ISN&rsquo;T OURS!&rdquo;</small></h2>


<p>Half an hour later Tom Parsons and his
chums left the antique upholstering shop, richer
in the possession of an old warming pan, which
they did not want, poorer in the sum of six dollars,
but also possessing more information than
they at first had regarding the Hebrew to whom
had been traded their old chair&mdash;or, at least, the
chair they hoped would prove to be theirs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name is a common Hebrew one,&rdquo; the
dealer told them, when he had been thawed out
by the trade, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t believe it was Cohen.
Anyhow, he lives on the Medford Road, just beyond
the village of Rosevale. I remember that,
because he told me how long it took him to drive
in from there. But if he shouldn&rsquo;t have the chair
on which you fellows seem so bent, I can fix you
up. I&rsquo;ve got an ancient Colonial one that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ve got all we need to-day,&rdquo; said
Phil, as he and his chums walked out. &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo;
he exclaimed, as he stood on the sidewalk. &ldquo;If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
we hadn&rsquo;t made a break when we did, he&rsquo;d have
sold us a Spanish sideboard or a Holland tiled
fireplace. Come on, fellows, we must get on the
trail of this Hebrew gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we can&rsquo;t to-day,&rdquo; spoke Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kindlings will want us to get into our football
togs as soon as we get back, and jump out at
practice. No chance to chase off around the country,
looking for an unknown furniture dealer out
Rosevale way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Sid. &ldquo;Well, we can go to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m full up with lectures to-morrow,&rdquo; objected
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, some of us can go,&rdquo; declared Frank.
&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t let that chair get away again.&rdquo; For,
though he was a new chum, he felt the same interest
in the recovery of the missing piece of furniture
as did his friends. &ldquo;I can stand a few more
cuts, and I can get off right after practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can go with you,&rdquo; suggested Tom.</p>

<p>The two did manage to get away the next day,
taking a trolley car as far as it went, and hiring a
farmer to drive them to the village of Rosevale,
a quaint little place. The farmer said he knew of
no second-hand furniture dealers in that vicinity,
but the boys had hopeful visions, and, dismissing
their rig, as they intended to hire another in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
to drive back, they tramped along the country
roads, making inquiries wherever they could.</p>

<p>But fate was against them. Late that afternoon,
having covered many miles, they gave up,
and made arrangements to be driven back to
where they could get a trolley car to Randall.</p>

<p>They had called on many men who dealt in old
furniture, and some who made a specialty of
upholstering. Some were Hebrews, and some
were not. But none had the chair they sought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if that Yankee was fooling us?&rdquo;
asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I guess he meant all right, but he couldn&rsquo;t
tell us any better than he did,&rdquo; replied Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re out six bones for that warming
pan,&rdquo; went on Tom, regretfully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to
see him again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did, but the dealer insisted that he had
told them to the best of his ability. He offered
to get the man&rsquo;s name and correct address the
next time he saw him, but this was not likely to
be soon.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile our friends were without
their chair, and their spasmodic efforts to discover
the mystery of the clocks had amounted to
nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you what it is,&rdquo; said Kindlings to them
one day. &ldquo;If you chaps don&rsquo;t perk up, and come
to practice a little oftener, you&rsquo;ll find yourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
on the side lines when the Boxer game comes off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That put more &ldquo;ginger&rdquo; into Tom and his
chums, for they had been rather neglecting practice
of late in their efforts to locate their chair.
They had, however, almost given up ever seeing
the ancient piece of furniture again.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile matters concerning the lawsuit
were not going any too smoothly. A most
careful search had been made for the missing quit-claim
deed, and without it, it was rumored, the
court proceedings must soon come to an end, with
the eviction of the college authorities from the
ground in dispute.</p>

<p>There were dark days for Randall, and only
the hope of winning the football championship
kept up the hearts of the students. Nor was this
hope any too strong, for there were whispers as
to the prowess of Boxer Hall. Randall had won
her final game before the big struggle, and now
was devoting all her energies to playing off the
championship tie.</p>

<p>New plays were tried and rejected. A different
code of signals was put in vogue, for it was
rumored that Boxer Hall was &ldquo;on&rdquo; to those in
use.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say Langridge is playing his head off
this year,&rdquo; declared Tom one night, when a crowd
of the football boys had gathered in the room of
our friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll go stale,&rdquo; suggested Holly Cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t if he can help it,&rdquo; was Sid&rsquo;s opinion.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been waiting all season to get a whack
at us fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it will make the game lively,&rdquo; declared
Kindlings. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give Boxer Hall all she
wants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jerry Jackson, who was sitting on the old couch
with Sid, moved to a more comfortable position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a wonder you fellows
wouldn&rsquo;t either renovate your furniture, or
else get some new. Joe and I got some swell
stuff the other day from an old Shylock of a chap
that has a joint out Rosedale way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out where?&rdquo; asked Tom, quickly, catching at
the name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out in a little place called Rosedale,&rdquo; repeated
Jerry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you mean Rose<i>vale</i>, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked
Sid. &ldquo;We heard of that fellow, but we couldn&rsquo;t
find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I mean Rose<i>dale</i>&mdash;d-a-l-e,&rdquo; spelled Jerry.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an ancient Hebrew&mdash;rather a decent chap,
too, and he had a lot of antique stuff. Joe and
I bought a fine sofa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A peach!&rdquo; declared the twin brother. &ldquo;You
can go to sleep on it standing up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this fellow&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; asked Phil,
quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Rosenkranz,&rdquo; replied Jerry. &ldquo;But he hasn&rsquo;t
got any more sofas. We bought the last one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he any chairs?&rdquo; inquired Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A raft of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And his place is in Rose<i>dale</i>, and not Rose<i>vale</i>?&rdquo;
spoke Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; the Jersey twin asserted. &ldquo;The
two places are in opposite directions. I guess we
ought to know. Joe and I were out on a walk one
day, and we saw the sofa in his window. He has
his shop in one side of his house&mdash;a queer old
place with a lot of Russian brasses. He had one
samovar that was a pippin, but he wanted eight
dollars for it, and the sofa broke us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows!&rdquo; cried Tom, excitedly, &ldquo;I believe we
are on the right track at last!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Track of what?&rdquo; demanded Jerry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our chair,&rdquo; and Tom quickly told what little
was known. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s evident,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the
Yankee dealer got twisted between Rose<i>vale</i> and
Rose<i>dale</i>. They&rsquo;re as alike as two peas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s Rose<i>dale</i> for ours as soon as we can
get there in the morning!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;This time
I hope we&rsquo;re on the right trail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ve been in the right church, but the
wrong pew, so often that it&rsquo;s getting to be monotonous,&rdquo;
commented Sid.</p>

<p>Mr. Rosenkranz proved to be a Hebrew gentleman
of the old-fashioned type&mdash;venerable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
with a long, straggly beard. He greeted the
boys courteously when they called on him two
days later, as that was the first chance they had to
make the trip.</p>

<p>With a voice that trembled with hope, Tom
asked about an old-fashioned easy chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure I have him,&rdquo; declared the Hebrew,
eagerly, scenting a trade. &ldquo;Ven effer you vants an
easy chair, comes you to Isaac Rosenkranz, und
you get him. I show you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys followed him to the rear of the store.
There, amid a pile of broken furniture, old stoves,
odds and ends that seemed utterly worthless, but
which seemed to constitute the entire stock-in-trade
of the dealer, they saw a big chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried Phil, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ours&mdash;ours!&rdquo; gasped Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No mistake this time,&rdquo; murmured Tom.
&ldquo;Chair, allow me to present you to our new member,
Frank Simpson; this is the chair you have
heard so much about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of it?&rdquo; asked the big Californian,
as he pretended to make a bow to the article of
furniture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, we can&rsquo;t be mistaken,&rdquo; declared Phil.
&ldquo;There are the claw feet, lions on the arms, and
all that. That&rsquo;s our chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your chair?&rdquo; asked the dealer, quickly. &ldquo;Ha,
yes, I see, if you <i>buys</i> him!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys looked at each other. What was to
be done? At length Tom hit upon the simplest
plan. It was no doubt their chair, he explained,
and he told how it had disappeared. They could
recover it by process of law, he went on, when Mr.
Rosenkranz evinced a desire to hold it, but they
would pay a reasonable price for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind you, only to get it back in a hurry,
though,&rdquo; declared Tom, &ldquo;for it&rsquo;s ours by right.
But I think it will be a lucky hunch for the football
team, if we get it before the big game with
Boxer Hall Saturday. So, Mr. Rosenkranz, how
much do you want for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dealer named a preposterous sum, but the
boys were shrewd, and beat him down. Finally,
when he had admitted that the chair was not likely
to sell soon, because it was in poor repair, he consented
to part with it for a reasonable sum. He
confirmed what the Yankee dealer had said, that
he had acquired it in a trade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; said Tom, passing over
the money. &ldquo;Now, how can we get it home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was rather a problem, as the chair was big
and clumsy, and they were quite a distance from
Randall. But finally, on payment of a further
small sum, the dealer offered to deliver it to the
college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible that we&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo;
said Tom, as they were on their way back that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
afternoon, the Hebrew promising to bring the
chair to them on the morrow. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a
celebration in honor of its return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing in the fancy eats line until after the
big game, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; objected Sid. &ldquo;Kindlings
and Lighton will sit down on that. But we&rsquo;ll have
a double celebration after we do up Boxer Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish it was to-morrow&mdash;I mean, so we could
sit in the old chair,&rdquo; went on Phil, almost as eager
as a child.</p>

<p>But the chair did not come the next day, and
after fretting and worrying, the boys received a
badly written, and worse spelled, postal from Mr.
Rosenkranz, explaining that his horse was sick,
but that he would deliver the chair as soon as the
animal was well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, there&rsquo;s a hoodoo about that chair,&rdquo; declared
Tom, as he went out to football practice
with his mates.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of the big game with
Boxer Hall that an ancient wagon, drawn by a
decrepit horse, drove up to Randall College. At
first the students were inclined to make game of
the outfit, but when Phil and Tom discovered that
it was Mr. Rosenkranz with their chair, there was
a change of heart. For the belief that the chair
might prove to be a mascot or &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; hunch had
grown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; cried Sid, seeing the old piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of furniture on the wagon. &ldquo;Now, up into our
room with her, fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and don&rsquo;t stop to admire it all day,
either,&rdquo; called Kindlings. &ldquo;I want you in practice
right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chums promised, but they could hardly tear
themselves away from the room where, once
more, reposed the old chair. It looked as natural
as it ever had, and its sojourn &ldquo;in the land of the
Philistines,&rdquo; as Tom declared, had apparently not
harmed it any.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I declare, the old clock seems glad to see it
back,&rdquo; declared Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sure does,&rdquo; agreed Sid, sinking down on
the sofa. That piece of furniture seemed to creak
and groan out a welcome to its fellow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll draw lots to see who has the honor of
first sitting in the old chair, and then we&rsquo;ll get out
on the field,&rdquo; suggested Tom.</p>

<p>He himself drew the lucky number. With
something of a little ceremony he made ready to
sink down into the depths of the chair. Slowly
he let himself back.</p>

<p>A cloud of dust, as of yore, arose around him,
making Phil, Sid and Frank sneeze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re greeting you, old chap!&rdquo; cried Tom
to the chair.</p>

<p>He leaned back. His chums, watching him,
saw a look of wonder come over his face. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
his hand went under the seat, and began feeling
there. Tom leaped up, raising more dust&mdash;a regular
cloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? A pin stick you?&rdquo; asked
Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pin? No. But, say, fellows, this isn&rsquo;t our
chair!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not our chair?&rdquo; echoed Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not&mdash;not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; faltered Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not our chair!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, decidedly, as
he sat down in it again. &ldquo;Here, Phil, you try it.
It looks like our chair, and it&rsquo;s built like it&mdash;upholstery
and all&mdash;it&rsquo;s a dead ringer, in fact, but it&rsquo;s
not <i>ours</i>!&rdquo; and Tom moved aside while Phil got
ready to make the test.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</a><br />
<small>A GREAT FIND</small></h2>


<p>The quarter-back let himself down critically
and easily into the chair. He was not in it more
than a few seconds, ere he arose quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to fit, just as our chair did,&rdquo; he said,
with a puzzled air. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>not</i> our chair,&rdquo; insisted Tom. &ldquo;Of course
when you sit in it it doesn&rsquo;t feel any different.
But look here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tilted it over backwards with a sudden
motion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you trying to do?&rdquo; indignantly demanded
Sid. &ldquo;Break it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to look under the seat,&rdquo; replied
Tom. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember how I nailed a
board on last term to hold it together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Sid. &ldquo;And I put on a
cleat near the back legs. See if that&rsquo;s there,
Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom had the underside of the chair exposed to
view now. Eagerly the lads peered forward. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
their gaze was presented no indiscriminately-nailed-on
boards or cleats, which they so well remembered.
Instead, there was a smooth brown
covering of cloth, such as is put under most upholstered
chairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; cried Tom, in triumph.
&ldquo;I knew this wasn&rsquo;t our chair as soon as I sat in
it and ran my hand under it. You could feel the
board I put on, and when that was missing I
knew something was wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, old man!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil. &ldquo;But
if this isn&rsquo;t our chair, we&rsquo;ve got its twin brother.
I never saw two more alike. But if it isn&rsquo;t ours,
whose is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo; asked Frank Simpson.
&ldquo;This mystery is only beginning, fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That dealer gave us the wrong chair,&rdquo; said
Tom. &ldquo;He must have another one in his shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe so,&rdquo; declared Phil. &ldquo;If he had
had two he&rsquo;d have mentioned it when we were out
there. Besides, we would have seen it. Frank,
are you sure this is the chair you saw in the shop
window of that Yankee dealer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t be sure of it, of course. It looks
like it, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we certainly are up against it,&rdquo; declared
Tom. &ldquo;Wait a minute, I&rsquo;ll soon find out what it
means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started from the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you going?&rdquo; called Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see Rosenkranz and ask him
about this mix-up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late,&rdquo; declared Phil. &ldquo;Rosenkranz
is quite a distance toward home by this time.
We&rsquo;ll see him later&mdash;to-morrow, after the game.
But it sure is a queer mix-up. Who&rsquo;d ever suppose
there was another chair like ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This one is newer,&rdquo; announced Tom, who had
turned it right side up again, and was critically
examining it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not newer, I guess,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;Only it
hasn&rsquo;t had the usage ours got. This is evidently
of the same vintage, but has been reposing in some
one&rsquo;s back parlor for centuries, with the curtains
down and the blinds closed to keep out the sun.
But a fair exchange is no robbery, and I don&rsquo;t
know but what we&rsquo;re just as well off. We have a
better chair than ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have our own,&rdquo; declared Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So would I,&rdquo; added Tom. &ldquo;It sat easier,&rdquo;
and he dropped into the chair, and lolled back
critically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, give me a show at it,&rdquo; begged Sid. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t had my sitting yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom arose reluctantly, and, as he did so, there
came a knock on the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; cried Phil.</p>

<p>It was Wallops, the messenger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Captain Woodhouse
wants you gentlemen to come out on the gridiron
at once, for practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;We were nearly
forgetting that in the excitement over the chair.
Tell the captain we&rsquo;ll be right out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was hard, snappy practice against the
unfortunate scrub, and as it progressed the captain
and coach looked more gratified than at any
time that season.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re fit, all right,&rdquo; declare Kindlings, with
sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Lighton, &ldquo;but
you&rsquo;ve got the fight of your life ahead of you, old
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it&mdash;but we&rsquo;ll win!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom and his three chums returned from practice
for a brief rest before the game. It was a
holiday, with no lessons or lectures to mar the
sport.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First shot at the chair!&rdquo; cried Tom, as he
burst into the room. He threw himself into the
big piece of upholstered furniture. There was a
sudden cracking, breaking and tearing sound, and
the whole bottom of the chair seemed to drop out.
A cloud of dust arose. Tom was like a person
who had sat upon a barrel, the head of which had
collapsed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, wow!&rdquo; he cried, as he vainly struggled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
to get up. &ldquo;I say, can&rsquo;t some of you fellows give
me a hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, hurt?&rdquo; asked Phil, anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;m wedged in here as if I&rsquo;d sat on a
drum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They pulled him out, and through the settling
cloud of dust gazed at the ruin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you have gone and done it,&rdquo; said Sid,
reproachfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I have,&rdquo; admitted Tom, regretfully, as
he moved the chair to one side. Several of the
bottom boards were on the floor. On top of them,
amid a little pile of dirt and splinters, was a
folded paper. Tom picked it up. He knocked
the dust from it and slowly and wonderingly read
several lines of writing on the front, and, as he
read, a look of bewilderment came over his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why, fellows!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Look&mdash;look
here! A deed&mdash;an old deed given by Simon
Hess to Jacob Randall, in consideration of&mdash;and
so forth and so forth&mdash;for the purpose of&mdash;um&mdash;setting
aside land on which to erect a college.
Why, great Cæsar&rsquo;s grandmother&rsquo;s pumpkin
pie!&rdquo; almost yelled Tom, &ldquo;this is the missing
quit-claim deed that everyone is looking for! The
deed on which the title to the college depends! It
was in that old chair!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV</a><br />
<small>THE EXCITED STRANGER</small></h2>


<p>At first, Tom&rsquo;s chums did not know whether
or not he was joking. They crowded around him
and looked over his shoulder as he unfolded the
paper. The inner contents bore out the endorsement
on the face of the document.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, all right!&rdquo; cried Frank. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
quit-claim deed, as sure as you&rsquo;re a foot high!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And does possession of it mean that Randall
College is all right?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; asserted Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how in the world did it ever get inside
that chair?&rdquo; demanded Phil. &ldquo;This is the greatest
mystery yet. The loss of our chair and clock
aren&rsquo;t in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; agreed Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What had we better do?&rdquo; asked Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get this deed into the hands of Dr. Churchill
as soon as possible,&rdquo; decided Tom. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll lock
it in the safe, whence it can&rsquo;t disappear again,
and then they&rsquo;ll call off the suit against Randall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
I guess this will put a crimp in Lawyer Langridge,
all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was this Jacob Randall mentioned in the
deed?&rdquo; asked Frank, who was carefully reading
the document.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he was some relative to the Randall who
founded the college,&rdquo; declared Phil. &ldquo;Randall,
the founder, got it later, and endowed the college.
Jove! but this is a great find, all right, eh, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing I came down hard in that
seat, or we&rsquo;d never found the deed,&rdquo; went on
Tom. &ldquo;Otherwise we might have traded back
this chair for our own, and never would have
known a thing about the quit-claim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where <i>is</i> our chair?&rdquo; asked Sid. &ldquo;And
how in the name of the sacred cow did the deed
get in the seat of this one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, don&rsquo;t ask any more questions, or I&rsquo;ll go
batty,&rdquo; declared Tom. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s take this
deed to Prexy right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was such a momentous occasion that nothing
less than a full delegation of the four &ldquo;guardsmen&rdquo;
could do justice to it, so the quartette of
chums invaded the office of Dr. Churchill, to that
gentleman&rsquo;s no small amazement. On the way
our heroes met several of their chums, but they
did not mention their find, thinking it best to let
the proper authorities know of it first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahem! Is this a strike, gentlemen?&rdquo; asked
the president, with a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a &lsquo;find&rsquo;!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, and he held out
the deed.</p>

<p>To say that Dr. Churchill was surprised would
be but faintly to express it. He eagerly questioned
the boys, who as eagerly answered, telling
the story of their missing clock and chair from
the beginning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; went on the president,
with a puzzled shake of his head. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll take
good care of this quit-claim deed, and we can
make inquiries later. You have rendered a service
to Randall to-day, gentlemen, that she will
not soon forget. I thank you personally, and,
later, I will see that you receive the recognition
you deserve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; whispered Tom to his chums, for
the good old doctor was much affected. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
nearly time for the game, and we don&rsquo;t want to
miss that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Murmuring over and over again his thanks at
the unexpected discovery, Dr. Churchill locked the
deed in the safe, stating that he would take immediate
steps to have the court matters brought to a
close, if possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For this, I think, settles forever the title of
Randall College,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are now secure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom and his chums hurried back to their room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Dr. Churchill had requested them to say nothing
for a little while regarding the finding of the deed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for Boxer Hall,&rdquo; remarked Phil, grimly,
as he looked at his watch. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll begin to arrive
in about an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wallops, the messenger, stepped toward our
friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a gentleman just gone up to your
room,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He was inquiring for you, and
I sent him up. He said he&rsquo;d wait outside until
you came back from the president&rsquo;s office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; asked Tom. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s some
of our folks, fellows, come to see the big game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I think he is a stranger,&rdquo; remarked the
messenger.</p>

<p>Wondering who could be paying them a visit
at this time, our heroes hastened their steps. Outside,
in the corridor, they saw a man excitedly
pacing up and down. He approached them
eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you Mr. Parsons, Mr. Clinton, and&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
He paused, as if trying to remember
the other names.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simpson and Henderson,&rdquo; finished Tom.
&ldquo;Did you want to see us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do, very much! Did you receive a
big chair from a dealer named Rosenkranz, a few
days ago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We received it to-day,&rdquo; spoke Phil. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;May I look at it?&rdquo; went on the man, eagerly.
&ldquo;I have reason to think that it is mine, and that
I have yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last!&rdquo; murmured Tom. &ldquo;Once more on
the trail of the mystery at last! Like a prima
donna&rsquo;s final-final concert. Yes, you may see the
chair, and welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened the door of their room, and at the
first glance inside, the stranger noted the chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo; he cried, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what <i>we</i> thought&mdash;at first,&rdquo; spoke Sid,
calmly.</p>

<p>The stranger paid no attention to the boys now.
He went over to the chair, in the bottom part of
which the boards had again been fitted loosely.
The man put his hand underneath, and, as he did
so, the boards fell down once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Someone has been
tampering with my chair! There is something
missing! Something valuable! Did you lads
take anything from this chair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What might it have been?&rdquo; inquired Tom,
calmly, motioning to his chums to keep silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A paper&mdash;a document&mdash;a valuable document!
Did you take it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We found a certain paper,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;I
sat in the chair a little too hard, the boards
dropped, and there was a paper in there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine! Where is it now? I demand it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy,&rdquo; counseled Tom. &ldquo;Do you know what
that paper was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say I do! Give it to me at once!
You may keep the chair if you like, but give me
the paper!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man was getting more and more excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That paper,&rdquo; said Tom, calmly, &ldquo;was a missing
quit-claim deed to property owned by Randall
College. The loss of it entailed a lawsuit which
is still pending. We found the deed, and, of
course, that brings the suit to an end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is that deed?&rdquo; demanded the man,
angrily. &ldquo;It was in my chair, and I want it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was in the chair&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t now,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;It is where you can&rsquo;t get it&mdash;in Dr. Churchill&rsquo;s
safe, and Randall College is rid of her enemies!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give&mdash;me&mdash;back&mdash;my&mdash;deed!&rdquo; fairly howled
the man.</p>

<p>He seemed as if he would strike Tom, but the
plucky end faced him fearlessly. Suddenly from
outside came a burst of cheers. They welled to
the ears of our heroes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Boxer Hall crowd!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re here for the big game! Come on, fellows!
Now to play for our lives!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once again came the burst of cheers. Looking
from their windows, our friends could see a
crowd of Boxer Hall students, arriving in big
stages, which they had hired. Their cries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
greeting and defiance were answered by those of
the Randall lads, who came pouring out on the
campus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My deed&mdash;where is my deed? Give it to
me!&rdquo; repeated the stranger, eagerly.</p>

<p>Tom turned on him like a flash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; the end cried. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
you, and I don&rsquo;t know what your game is. But
I <i>do</i> know that we&rsquo;ve got the deed, and that we&rsquo;re
going to keep it. Now, you get out of here, and
don&rsquo;t come back. We&rsquo;re going to play football,
and if you want to make any claim, you go to the
Randall lawyers. Now&mdash;vamoose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom pointed to the door. The man looked at
him defiantly, and seemed about to leap at the
lad. Then, with a slinking glance, he departed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Phil, as the echoes of his
footsteps died away down the corridor, &ldquo;what do
you think of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it the limit?&rdquo; demanded Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worse and more of it,&rdquo; added Frank. &ldquo;I
wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No time to wonder now,&rdquo; interrupted Tom,
briskly. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t anything to worry about
from that chap. The deed is safe. Now, come
on, get into our togs, and wipe up the ground
with Boxer Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV</a><br />
<small>THE WINNING TOUCHDOWN</small></h2>


<p>What a crowd there was! It seemed to surge
all over the grandstands, hiding the boards from
sight, so that the structure looked like a solid
mass of human beings. Old men there were, and
elderly ladies, too, and young men&mdash;and maidens&mdash;girls,
girls, girls, everywhere, their pretty hats
and bright wraps making the otherwise dull and
cloudy day seem like a fairy garden.</p>

<p>Nearly everyone from Fairview Institute was
on hand, and the girls sat together, chanting songs&mdash;sometimes
for Randall and sometimes for
Boxer Hall. The former contingent was led by
the friends of our heroes, Miss Tyler, Miss Harrison
and Miss Clinton.</p>

<p>It was almost time for the game to start, and
Bean Perkins had led his crowd of shouters, cheerers
and singers in various calls and melodies. Out
on the field were the players, nearly two score of
them, for each college had plenty of substitutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a game for blood, all right,&rdquo;
murmured Tom, who, standing with his three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
chums, watched Boxer Hall at practice. &ldquo;Look
how they get into play on the jump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can do it, too,&rdquo; declared Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got some good kickers,&rdquo; announced
Sid, critically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So have we,&rdquo; fired back Phil, who seemed to
resent any implied slight of the Randall team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard where Langridge is going to
play?&rdquo; asked Frank Simpson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Against me, someone said,&rdquo; replied Tom.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been shifted to right end, I hear, and I
wish he wasn&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;ll be some scrapping,
sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him get your goat,&rdquo; advised Phil.</p>

<p>Speculation as to the position of the players
was soon set at rest, when the list was announced
This was the lineup.</p>

<p>It was stated that two halves of thirty minutes
each would be played, and it was also known that
some of the old-time rules, as regarded play,
would be used, for the Tonaka Lake League had
their own ideas on this subject.</p>

<p>The crowd continued to increase, and when
Captain Miller, of Boxer Hall, and Captain
Woodhouse, of Randall, met for a conference,
the stands had overflowed into the field, where
the officers had trouble keeping the crowd back
of the ropes.</p>

<p>Boxer won the toss, and there was a momentary
feeling of disappointment at this, but it soon
passed away, for there was no wind, and little
advantage to be gained by selecting a goal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em on our own grounds,&rdquo;
remarked Tom, in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s one advantage,&rdquo; agreed Phil.
&ldquo;Oh, if we can only win, old man&mdash;if we only
can! Then Randall will come into her own again,
and down all her enemies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re <i>going</i> to win,&rdquo; said Tom, simply, as if
that settled it.</p>

<p>Boxer elected to defend the south goal, which
gave the ball to Randall to be kicked off. Holly
Cross topped it on a little mound of dirt. He
looked to Kindlings for a confirmatory nod, which
the captain gave, after a glance at his men. The
Boxer Halls were on the alert. The whistle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the referee blew, and Holly&rsquo;s toe made a dent in
the new yellow ball. Away it sailed far into
Boxer&rsquo;s territory. Langridge made the catch, and
started over the chalk marks with speed, protected
by good interference. But with a fierceness
which it seemed that nothing could stop, Tom
Parsons circled in, and made one of the best
tackles of his career, as he brought his old enemy
down with a thud to the ground, on Boxer&rsquo;s thirty-eight
yard line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now the real battle begins,&rdquo; murmured Tom,
as he ran to his place, while the opponents of
Randall lined up, the quarter-back singing out his
signal.</p>

<p>Fred Cooper was given the ball, and made a
try at getting around Randall&rsquo;s right end, but
Jerry Jackson and his support were right there,
and Cooper was nailed, after a gain of about four
yards. It was a splendid defense on the part of
Randall, and her cohorts were glad, for Boxer
had some big players that year, and there was
fear that she would smash through. In fact, so
fearful was Captain Miller after that first try that
he called for a kick.</p>

<p>It was well done, and Cook sent the pigskin
sailing far back toward Randall&rsquo;s goal posts. Joe
Jackson caught it, and began a run which brought
the crowd to its feet as if by magic, while thousands
of throats yelled encouragement, and Bean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Perkins broke his cane to slivers, in his excitement.
Past man after man of the Boxer team did
Joe dodge, until he was nearly in the centre of
the field before he was downed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s our chance,&rdquo; murmured Phil, as he
knelt to take the pigskin when Holly should snap it
back.</p>

<p>Phil signaled for Sid Henderson to take the
ball, and take it Sid did, smashing through the
Boxer line for five yards. Joe Jackson was next
called upon, and proved a good ground-gainer.
Then came the turn of Pete Backus, who got into
action on the jump. In less than three minutes of
play Randall had ripped out seventeen yards
through the hardest sort of a defense, and this
exhibition of skill, pluck and line-smashing was a
revelation to those who had feared for their
favorite college. It was disheartening to Boxer
Hall. Randall had had no need to kick.</p>

<p>Another signal came, and Frank Simpson, with
a tremendous heave, opened up a big hole for Joe
Jackson to dart through. Then, and not until
then, did Boxer prove that she could hold, for, in
response to the frantic appeals of her captain, his
men stopped Joe, after a small gain.</p>

<p>Then came some kicking, and Boxer had the
ball again. With desperate energy she began at
her smashing tactics once more, and to such advantage
that she was advancing the leather well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
up the field. Something seemed to be the matter
with Randall. She was giving way&mdash;a slump.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold! hold! Hold &rsquo;em!&rdquo; pleaded Dan
Woodhouse.</p>

<p>His men braced, but either they did not work
together, or they braced at the wrong moment,
for on came Boxer Hall. Right up the field they
went, until they were only twenty yards away
from the Randall goal line.</p>

<p>There were glum feelings in the hearts of the
supporters of the yellow and maroon, and wild,
delirious joy in the ranks of the enemies, for the
stands were rioting with cheers and songs, while
above all came the deep-throated demand for:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Touchdown! Touchdown!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;ll get it, too, if we don&rsquo;t stop &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
thought Tom, in despair. He had been playing
well, and taking care of all the men who came his
way, but that was all he could do.</p>

<p>Then Randall braced, and, in the nick of time,
and held to such advantage that Boxer had to
kick. Joe Jackson caught the ball, and was gathering
himself for a run back, when Langridge,
who had broken through with incredible swiftness,
tackled him, almost in the very spot where
the Randall full-back had grabbed the pigskin.
Langridge and Joe went down in a heap, and how
it happened, Joe, with tears in his eyes, later,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
could not explain. But the leather rolled away
from him.</p>

<p>Like a flash Langridge was up, had picked the
ball from the ground, and amid a perfect pandemonium
of yells, was sprinting for Randall&rsquo;s goal,
with not a man between him and the last chalk
mark.</p>

<p>It was almost a foregone conclusion that he
would touch down the ball, and he did, though
Tom sprinted after him, with such running as he
had seldom done before. But to no avail.</p>

<p>To the accompaniment of a whirlwind of
cheers, Langridge made the score, and then calmly
sat on the ball, while the others rushed at him.
But he was safe from attack.</p>

<p>Oh, the bitterness in the hearts of the Randall
lads! It was as gall and wormwood to them,
while they lined up behind their goal posts and
watched Lynn Railings kick the goal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six to nothing against us,&rdquo; murmured Phil,
with a sob in his throat. &ldquo;Oh, fellows&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could not go on, but walked silently back
to the middle of the field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, boys, give &rsquo;em the &lsquo;Wallop&rsquo; song!&rdquo;
cried Bean Perkins, with a joyousness that was
only assumed, and the strains of that jolly air
welled out over the field, mingling with the triumphant
battle cries of Boxer.</p>

<p>But the Randall players heard, and it put some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
heart into them. The game went on, with slight
gains on either side, for ten minutes more. There
were forward passes and on-side kicks tried, and
an exchange of punts. Once Randall was penalized
for holding, and twice Boxer had the ball
taken from her for off-side plays. The leather
was kept near the middle of the field, and it was
evident that a most stubborn battle would mark
the remainder of the championship game. Yet
the advantage of first scoring was with Boxer, and
it gave them additional strength, it seemed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows, we <i>must</i> get a touchdown!&rdquo; declared
Kindlings, with tears in his eyes, when time was
called, as Charles Baker was knocked out, and
Ted Sanders went in as the Boxer left half.</p>

<p>Randall had the ball, and with the energy of
despair, was rushing it down the field. The loss
of Baker, who was one of the mainstays of the
Boxer team, seemed to affect Randall&rsquo;s opponents,
for they appeared to crumple under the smashing
attack directed at them. In turn, Sid, Pete and
Joe rushed through the holes torn for them.
They seemed resistless, and the sight brought
forth a round of cheers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for the &lsquo;Conquer or Die&rsquo; song,&rdquo; called
Bean, hoarsely, leaping to his feet and waving
his battered cane and the tattered ribbons.
&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s the time. We need that touchdown
they&rsquo;re going to get!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>His voice carried to the struggling players, for
there was a moment of silence. Then, as the
grand Latin strains broke forth, they seemed to
electrify Tom and his chums. The players fairly
jumped at the opposing line.</p>

<p>Within two yards of the goal chalk mark Pete
Backus was given the ball. With tremendous
strength, the big Californian opened a hole for
him. Pete slipped through, and staggered forward.
Cook, the Boxer full, tried to tackle him,
and did get him down, but, with a wiggle and a
squirm, Pete was free, and the next instant had
made the touchdown.</p>

<p>Randall&rsquo;s supporters went wild with delight,
and Bean could not shout for some time after the
fearful and weird yells he let loose. He had to
take some throat lozenges to relieve the strain.</p>

<p>There was some disappointment when the goal
was missed, leaving the score six to five, in favor
of Boxer. But Randall felt that she now had the
measure of her opponents.</p>

<p>The rest of the half was finished, with neither
side scoring again, and then came a period of
much-needed rest, for the lads had played with
fierce energy.</p>

<p>The opening of the second half was rather
slow. The ball changed hands several times, and
it seemed as if both sides were playing warily for
an opening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellows, we&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to get another touchdown,&rdquo;
declared Kindlings. &ldquo;That one point may
beat us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get it,&rdquo; asserted Phil, when time was
being taken out to enable Sid Henderson to get
back his wind, for he had been knocked out by
a fierce tackle.</p>

<p>Then the battle was resumed. Up to now, Tom
and his old enemy, Langridge, had not clashed
much, though Langridge kept up a running fire of
low-voiced, insulting talk against Tom, to which
our hero did not reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s only trying to get my goat,&rdquo; Tom explained
to Frank Simpson. Then came a play
around Tom&rsquo;s end, when Boxer had the ball, and
Langridge deliberately punched his opponent.
Like a flash, Tom drew back his arm to return
the blow, and then he realized that he was in the
game, and he got after the man with the ball.
Following the scrimmage, he said, with quiet determination:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Langridge, if you do that again, I&rsquo;ll smash
you in the eye,&rdquo; and from the manner of saying it,
Langridge knew he would carry it out. Thereafter
he was more careful.</p>

<p>Try as Randall did, she could not seem to get
the ball near enough to make an attempt for a
field goal, or to rush it over for a touchdown.
On the other hand, Boxer was equally unable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
make the needful gains. There was much kicking,
and the time was rapidly drawing to a close.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to do it! We&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to do it!
We&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to do it!&rdquo; said the captain over and
over again. He begged and pleaded with his
men. The coach urged them in all the terms of
which he was master.</p>

<p>There were but two minutes more of play, and
Randall had the ball. It was within twenty-five
yards of the Boxer goal, and one attempt to rush
it through guard and tackle had resulted in only a
little gain.</p>

<p>It was a critical moment, for on the next few
plays depended the championship of the league.
Phil was doing some rapid thinking. Sid had just
had the ball, and had failed to gain. In fact, the
plucky left half-back had not fully recovered from
the effects of a fierce tackle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t expect him to come at them
again,&rdquo; thought Phil. &ldquo;But I wonder if old Sid
can do it. I&rsquo;m going to try him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The quarter-back was rattling off the signal.
Somewhat to his surprise, Sid heard himself called
upon for another trial. He almost resented it,
for he was very weary, and his ears were buzzing
from weakness.</p>

<p>And then he heard that song&mdash;the song that
always seemed to nerve Randall to a last effort.
The Latin words came sweetly over the field from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the cohorts on the big stand&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Aut Vincere, Aut
Mori!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Either We Conquer, or We Die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Might as well die, as to be defeated,&rdquo; thought
Sid, bitterly. The ball came back to him. Like a
flash he was in motion. The big Californian, as
he had done before several times in the game,
opened a hole so fiercely that the opposing players
seemed to shrink away from him.</p>

<p>Forward leaped Sid, with all the power of despair.
Forward! Forward!</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! See!&rdquo; cried Bean Perkins. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
through the line! He&rsquo;s going to make a touchdown&mdash;the
winning touchdown!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sid <i>was</i> through. Staggering and weak, but
through. Between him and the coveted goal line
now was but one player&mdash;the Boxer full-back&mdash;William
Cook. He crouched, waiting for Sid,
but there were few better dodgers than this same
Sid. On he came, wondering if his wind and legs
would hold out for the race he had yet to run&mdash;a
race with glory at the end&mdash;or bitter defeat on
the way.</p>

<p>Cook was opening and shutting his hands, in
eager anticipation of grasping Sid. His jaw was
set, his eyes gleamed. On came the half-back,
gathering momentum with every stride, until, just
as Cook thought he had him, Sid dodged to one
side, and kept on. There was now a clear field
ahead of him, and he was urged forward by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
frantic yells of his fellow players and the wild,
shouting crowds on the stands. Not a person was
seated. They were all standing up, swaying, yelling,
imploring, or praying, that Sid would keep
on&mdash;or fall or be captured before he crossed that
magical white line.</p>

<p>Sid kept on. Then there came a different yell.
It was from the Boxer stands. Tom, picking himself
out from a heap of players, saw Langridge
sprinting after Sid. And how the former bully of
Randall did run!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sid! Go on! Go on!&rdquo; implored Tom,
in a whisper, as if the youth could hear him.</p>

<p>And Sid went on. After him, fiercely, came
Langridge. The distance between them lessened.
Sid was staggering. His brain was reeling. His
legs tottered. The ball seemed about to slip from
his grasp, and he found himself talking to it, as to
a thing alive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay there, now&mdash;stay there&mdash;don&rsquo;t fall out.
And&mdash;and you legs&mdash;don&rsquo;t you give way&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you do it! Keep on, old man, keep on! You can
do it! You can do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus Sid muttered to himself. He heard the
patter of the running feet behind him. He did
not look to see who was coming&mdash;he dared not.
He felt that if he took his eyes off the last
white line ahead of him that he would stagger
and fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>The line was like the crystal globe that hypnotizes
one. It held his gaze.</p>

<p>On, and on, and on&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Sid fell in a heap. His breath left him. There
was a darkness before him. Down he went
heavily.</p>

<p>But, oh, what a shout came dimly to his ears!
What a wild riot of cries! He tried to look down
and see whether he had crossed the line before he
stumbled, but he could only see the brown earth
and green grass. He heard someone still running
after him. He lifted his head. There, just
before him, was the goal line.</p>

<p>With the energy of despair, <a href="#image01">he raised the ball
in his arms, and placed it over the chalk mark</a>,
holding it there with all his remaining strength,
when someone threw himself fiercely upon him.</p>

<p>It was Langridge, eager, wrathful and almost
beside himself with rage. But he was too late.
The ball was well over the last line, and, knowing
from the attitude of the Boxer player that it <i>was</i>
there, the great throng of Randall men and
women, young men and maidens, joined in one
great cry:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Touchdown! Touchdown!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was&mdash;the winning touchdown, for, as the
other players, some fearful, some hoping, came
rushing up, the final whistle blew, ending the contest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
that had resulted in championship for Randall.</p>

<p>And then, welling over the field once more,
came softly the song: &ldquo;Either We Conquer, or
We Die!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There were bonfires that night at Randall&mdash;bonfires
in which the football suits were burned,
for the eleven broke training in a blaze of glory.
Also there were feastings, for there was no ban
on eating now. And, likewise, there was much
rejoicing. For was not Randall champion again?
Had not her loyal sons again won a victory on
the gridiron? Therefore, let the gladness go
on!</p>

<p>Sid was the lion of the hour. It was his great
run&mdash;his struggle against long odds&mdash;that had
won the big game, and he was carried on the
shoulders of his mates, and his name was heralded
in song and story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was great, old man, great!&rdquo; cried Tom,
as they walked together from the gymnasium,
where there had been a sort of impromptu joy-meeting
after the feast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing like it ever seen at Randall,&rdquo; declared
Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing like it ever seen <i>anywhere</i>,&rdquo; put in
the big Californian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never could have done it, if you hadn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
opened the hole for me, Frank,&rdquo; spoke Sid,
gratefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just had to open that hole,&rdquo; was the retort.
&ldquo;I felt that I&rsquo;d tear those fellows limb from
limb if they didn&rsquo;t give way, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They did,&rdquo; finished Phil, with a laugh.</p>

<p>They had met their girl friends after the game,
and had received their congratulations. Then
had come a happy time, walking with them, then
the feasting, and now our friends were on their
way to their room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are only two things that are bothering
me,&rdquo; remarked Tom, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that&mdash;Langridge?&rdquo; asked Phil. &ldquo;Say,
he must have felt sick when he got to where Sid
was, and saw that it was a touchdown, all right!
Did he hurt you, Sid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he knocked the wind out of me&mdash;that
is, what there was left to knock. But I guess he
didn&rsquo;t mean to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he meant it, all right,&rdquo; declared Tom.
&ldquo;But I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of Langridge. I was going
to say that the two things that bothered me was
the mystery of the chair and the clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; came from Phil. &ldquo;I wonder who
that fellow was, and how the deed came to be in
his chair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must tell Prexy about it,&rdquo; decided Sid.
&ldquo;It may have a bearing on the case.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>They were deep in a discussion of possible explanations
of the various problems that vexed
them, when they turned down the corridor that
led to their room. There was so much noise
going on out on the campus&mdash;shouts and yells, and
the students circling about the bonfires&mdash;that the
footsteps of our friends made no sound. That
is why they were close upon a figure crouched in
front of their door before the kneeling one was
aware of their presence. Then the figure started
away. But Phil was too quick, and grabbed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve caught you!&rdquo; cried the quarter-back. &ldquo;So
you sneaked back, to see if you could find the deed,
eh?&rdquo; for he thought he had the stranger who had
before visited them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove, it&rsquo;s Lenton!&rdquo; cried Tom, catching a
glimpse of the face of the captive. And indeed
it was the odd student who was such an expert
with the file.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s got a false key!&rdquo; added Sid, as he
saw a bit of brass in the lad&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Here, you
little shrimp, what do you mean?&rdquo; and Sid shook
the lad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;please&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean anything,&rdquo; was the
stammering answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you trying to get into our room?&rdquo;
demanded Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;I was, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s our chair?&rdquo; came fiercely from Phil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got it! I never had it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you take our clock, and afterward exchange
it?&rdquo; asked Tom, determined to solve part
of the mystery, if not all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I had it, and I&mdash;I was coming back to
borrow it again,&rdquo; answered the odd student.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Borrow it?&rdquo; repeated Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all I did with your alarm clock.
Oh, fellows, I didn&rsquo;t mean anything wrong. I&rsquo;ll
tell you all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; said Phil, keeping a hold of the
intruder&rsquo;s collar. &ldquo;Come inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They entered the room, and Tom locked the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Phil, suggestively, as he pointed
out a chair to Lenton. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re ready to hear
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I borrowed your clock to take a wheel out,&rdquo;
said the odd student, simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To take a wheel out?&rdquo; repeated Sid, in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. In an alarm clock there is a certain size
cog wheel that I could find nowhere else. Fellows,
I am making a new kind of static electric machine,
and I needed a certain sized wheel. I tried
everywhere to get one, and I couldn&rsquo;t afford to
pay for having one made. Then, one day, I happened
to see your alarm clock in here. I thought,
perhaps, that it would have in it the wheel I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
wanted. I made a false key, sneaked in, and took
the clock out. Then I happened to think you&rsquo;d
want a timepiece, so I brought in that mahogany
one&mdash;it was a present to me from a friend in Chicago,
but I didn&rsquo;t care for it. The wheels weren&rsquo;t
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess <i>you&rsquo;ve</i> got wheels,&rdquo; murmured Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your alarm clock had just the right size wheel
in it,&rdquo; went on the odd student, &ldquo;so I took it out,
and made my electrical machine. Then I made
another wheel that would answer as well in your
clock, and I made the exchange back again. Now
my electrical machine is broken, and I need another
wheel from your clock, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were going to sneak in again and take it,&rdquo;
broke in Sid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I made another false key, for I accidentally
left the first one in the door when you came
and surprised me, the day I brought your clock
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you <i>ask</i> us for the clock?&rdquo; inquired
Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I was afraid you wouldn&rsquo;t let me take
it. I heard the fellows say how fond you were
of it. I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t miss a wheel from
it, if I gave you a better clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Another</i> one&mdash;not a <i>better</i>,&rdquo; insisted Phil.
&ldquo;But did you drop a letter in here one day?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did, to Bert Bascome, and I wondered
what had become of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We found it,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Was there something
in it about a clock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I bought an expensive alarm clock from
Bert, but I wrote rather sharply to tell him it
wasn&rsquo;t any good. It had the wrong kind of
wheels. Bascome was mad at me for not keeping
it to pay off some of the money he owes me.
That&rsquo;s all there is to tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; declared Sid. &ldquo;I guess
that explains everything. Bascome&rsquo;s denial was
justified.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we thought Langridge had a hand in it,&rdquo;
went on Phil. &ldquo;But there is still the chair and
deed to be explained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about the chair,&rdquo; insisted
Lenton, and they believed him. &ldquo;But could
I have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want the clock?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I just want to take out one of the wheels.
I&rsquo;ll put in another just as good,&rdquo; promised Lenton,
eagerly. And they let him have the battered
timepiece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, if we could only explain the chair matter
as easily, all would be well,&rdquo; commented Phil,
when Lenton had gone.</p>

<p>They had not long to wait. A little later a
message summoned them to the office of Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Churchill. The president greeted them pleasantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just had the lawyers here,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and they state that the quit-claim deed which you
boys found is genuine, and the very one that was
missing. It brings to an end the suit against the
college, and I wish to once more thank you lads.
The prohibition of silence is now removed, and
you are at liberty to tell your friends the good
news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have not heard it all,&rdquo; said Tom, and
he told about the visit of the excited stranger just
before the game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can explain that,&rdquo; went on the president,
with a smile, &ldquo;and also tell you where to
find your chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you?&rdquo; cried the three, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your visitor was a Mr. James Lawson,&rdquo; continued
Dr. Churchill, &ldquo;and he was the one who
made the claim against the college, being a distant
heir of Simon Hess. Without the quit-claim
deed being available to us, he was the ostensible
owner of our property. How he got possession
of the deed he would not say, though the lawyers
and I questioned him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he here?&rdquo; asked Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, your actions evidently frightened him,
for he called a little while ago to say that he gave
up all claims to the land. He stated that he
thought he had a right to the deed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How did it get in the old chair?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Being an heir of Simon Hess,&rdquo; went on the
doctor, &ldquo;this Mr. Lawson had some of the old
family furniture. Among the pieces was a chair,
similar to yours, which I understand was also a
Hess heirloom. Your chair was taken by a man
whom we engaged temporarily to do some janitor
work. He sold it to a second-hand dealer, and I
have only to-night learned his name and address.
The janitor was dismissed shortly after being
hired, as it was found that he was dishonest.
To-day I received a letter from him, begging forgiveness,
and telling about the chair he sold from
your room. But he did not mention a clock, for
I understand you also lost a timepiece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we have that back,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;But
about the chair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come to that, and tell you where to get
yours. It seems that Mr. Lawson retained possession
of the quit-claim deed, which he would not
tell how he obtained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One night, when looking it over in his home,
near Rosedale, he was interrupted by an unexpected
visitor. Not wishing his caller to see the
deed, he slipped it under the lining of the seat of
the old chair. Business matters came up immediately
afterward, and he went out, forgetting
about the document, which was left in the seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next day his wife, who liked new instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
of old furniture, sold the old armchair to a second-hand
dealer, deed and all, though, of course, she
did not know of the paper. Naturally, when Mr.
Lawson heard of his loss, he was frantic, for
on the deed his whole claim depended. He intended
to destroy the document to prevent it ever
being found by anyone so that it would benefit
Randall. But he reckoned without fate, which
stepped in most opportunely. He sought the old
chair, but it had gone from dealer to dealer,
until finally a Mr. Rosenkranz got it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You obtained it from him just before Mr.
Lawson called to claim his furniture, and later
he came on to the college. The rest fits in with
what you already know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, wouldn&rsquo;t that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Tom, and
then he happened to remember that he was in the
president&rsquo;s presence, and he stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your old chair is at this place,&rdquo; went on Dr.
Churchill, giving the address of a small dealer in
a nearby city. &ldquo;You may go and get it any time
you like,&rdquo; the good doctor concluded. &ldquo;And now
I think that this clears up the mystery. But, before
you go, let me congratulate you on the magnificent
victory of this afternoon. The nine did
exceedingly well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The president smiled benignly, unconscious of
the &ldquo;break&rdquo; he had made in calling the eleven a
&ldquo;nine,&rdquo; and the boys, joyful over the prospect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
an early recovery of their chair, left the office.
At last the mystery was ended.</p>

<p>There was more rejoicing in Randall when the
facts regarding the quit-claim deed became
known, and the next day formal notice of the
withdrawal of the suit was filed. There was some
talk about prosecuting Mr. Lawson, but there was
a doubt as to his real criminality, so nothing was
done.</p>

<p>And thus ended the troubles of Randall, not
only from a legal standpoint, but also from an
athletic, for her title to the championship of the
gridiron was firmly established. But there were
other battles of the field to come, and those who
are interested in them may read thereof in the
next volume of the series, to be called: &ldquo;For the
Honor of Randall; a Story of College Athletics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They look like twins, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; remarked
Tom, a few evenings later, when, having recovered
their own chair, it was placed beside the one
left by Mr. Lawson, for he did not come to claim
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if we had two more, we&rsquo;d have a collection,
and there&rsquo;d be one apiece,&rdquo; added Phil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the sofa&rsquo;s good enough for me,&rdquo; came
from Sid. &ldquo;I hope nobody borrows that to take
out a wheel, or some of the stuffing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the clock ticks as naturally as it always
did,&rdquo; commented Phil, as he took a seat in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
of the easy chairs, for Lenton had returned the
timepiece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they lived happily forever after,&rdquo; murmured
Tom, now half asleep, for it was warm
in the room. &ldquo;I say, are you fellows going to
the next Fairview frat. dance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we? Wild horses can&rsquo;t hold us back!&rdquo;
cried Sid, with energy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; murmured Tom, still more sleepily,
and then, as the chums lapsed into silence, there
sounded the loud and insistent ticking of the battered
alarm clock.</p>
